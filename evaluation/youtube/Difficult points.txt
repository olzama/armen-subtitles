Lines 41-45: The correct translation will reflect that there is a subtle difference between "молодой человек лет около 27" and "молодой человек лет 27 или около".

Lines 59-61 The word "раскосировали" is really "раскассировали". It means something like "to analyze, categorize". Since in the original the word is autotranscribed wrong, the translation may be affected. Pay attention to this in evaluation.

Lines 69-70: Pay attention to the poetic nature of the following line. Is "свободно" translated as "free" or perhaps "vacant"? "Vacant" for example, could be better (maybe). ###

Lines 82-83:  "но все не затем все со
страхом и не для того возражает Кириллов" -- difficult line.
This is a direct quote from Dostoyevski, but in any case, the coordinated constituent "все не затем все со
страхом и не для того" can be difficult to translate correctly. It means something like: "But they did it for the wrong reasons, and out of fear."

Lines 86-87 Here, "дерзновенные и далеко" really is "дерзновенный идальго". The automatic transcription got this wrong, and this may cause issues in the translation. Pay attention to this. Here, it is Don Quixote who tells Sancho that he is planning to follow the example of the knights of the past and go mad.###

Lines 154-158: Here, it may be difficult to get who is saying what. Verhovensky is saying to Kirillov: So, you are in such a state that you didn't even [eat] the chicken? -- And Kirillov interrupts: "I did eat!"

Time codes: 00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:43,740
Lines 168-169: "косточка на торте": neologism. The expression is "cherry on top", but the author says "косточка", which in Russian is both seed and bone. The word "bone" invokes associations with death. This may be difficult to convey. ###

Time codes: 00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:13,740
Lines 179-180: "Но и курица стало быть вакантна": unusual epithet "вакантна" for the chicken; usually used for places, so, this is creative use of language. The chicken is compared to something bigger (a person's place in life).###

Time codes: 00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:49,920
Lines 190-193: "А ребеночек-то с гарниром или так, без всего" - may be difficult to translate, due to the many meanings of the word "так". Here it means "just like this, without a garnish".###

Time codes: 00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:24,839
Lines 202-205: Here, the author is reciting a children's poem. A good translation will either translate the poem or will at least add a comment like [reciting a children's poem]. ###

Time codes: 00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:20,120
Line 256: The following line is an artifact of misheard clip in English (from the Orson Welles's movie). It should just be removed.

Time codes: 00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:39,779
Lines 258-260: Here, the syntax is complex. The translation should convey: the episode corresponds to the spirit of Cervantez's novel but not literally (not "to the letter").###
