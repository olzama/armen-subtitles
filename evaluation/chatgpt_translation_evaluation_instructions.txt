Evaluation Instructions for ChatGPT
====================================

Purpose:
--------
Evaluate translations of subtitle segments on three dimensions: Fluency, Faithfulness, and Tone/Style, with a focus on a specific annotated difficulty.

Inputs (per segment):
---------------------
Each evaluation will be based on:
- original_text (verbatim)
- translation_text — the translation of the same fragment (verbatim)
- difficulty_comment — a short description of the specific difficulty or focus point in the segment (e.g. intertextuality, metaphor, misattribution, etc.)

Evaluate only the part of the segment referred to in the comment, using surrounding text only for interpretation, not for penalty.

Evaluation Dimensions and Scoring:
----------------------------------
Each of the three categories should be scored as:
- 1.0 = Fully successful
- 0.5 = Partially adequate
- 0.0 = Fails or missing

You must also produce a brief summary (1–2 sentences) justifying the scores with reference to the difficulty.

1. Fluency
----------
Is the translation understandable and grammatically coherent at the local level?

- 1.0: Clear, natural, and well-formed target language, allowing for subtitle-style breaks.
- 0.5: Minor awkwardness or fragmentation that mildly affects readability.
- 0.0: Seriously garbled, ungrammatical, or hard to parse.

Note: Tolerate subtitle chunking or dangling edges unless they affect the main clause.

2. Faithfulness
---------------
Does the translation preserve the facts, logic, or assertions in the relevant part of the original?

- 1.0: All relevant meaning is accurately preserved.
- 0.5: Some details are lost, vague, or mistranslated; partial distortion.
- 0.0: Major factual loss or inversion; key ideas misrepresented or fabricated.

Note: Focus only on the portion addressed in the comment, not on the full segment.

3. Tone/Style
-------------
Does the translation match the genre, emotional tone, or literary/rhetorical style of the original?

- 1.0: Tone is appropriately preserved or adapted.
- 0.5: Style is partially flattened, neutralized, or shifted.
- 0.0: Tone is mismatched or completely lost.

Note: This includes humor, sarcasm, philosophical language, literary allusion, etc.

Output Format:
--------------
Return the result as a structured dictionary or JSON object containing:

{
  "fluency": 1.0,
  "faithfulness": 0.5,
  "tone_style": 1.0,
  "total": 2.5,
  "summary": e.g.: "Fluent English; minor factual omission; tone well preserved in literary allusion."
}

The total is the sum of the three scores.

Do Not:
-------
- Correct or rewrite the translation
- Penalize subtitle fragmentation
- Score beyond the specific difficulty mentioned

NOTE THAT MODIFYING THE INPUTS (THE ORIGINAL OR THE TRANSLATION) WILL LEAD TO REPEATING THE QUERY, WHICH IS HARMFUL FOR THE ENVIRONMENT.
