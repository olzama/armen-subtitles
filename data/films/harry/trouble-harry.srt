1
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,430
<i>Okay, I know how to handle your type!</i>

2
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,760
Well, old faithful,
that's your shooting for the day.

3
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,675
If we haven't rung up
at least two rabbits,

4
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,360
we deserve to go home empty-handed.

5
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,753
Yeah. Still, blessed are they
who expect nothing

6
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,877
for they shall not be disappointed.

7
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,040
Hmm.

8
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,953
Fewer things in life give
a man more pleasure than hunting.

9
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,475
It satisfies his primitive nature.

10
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,280
Striding through the woods,
picking up his kill.

11
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,400
Well, come on, old faithful.

12
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,871
There's plump rabbits
waiting for the frying pan.

13
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,469
If this can had four legs and a tail,
we'd be eating it tonight.

14
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,552
Clean through the heart.

15
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,592
For rice cake, I've done him in.

16
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,877
A harmless potshot at a rabbit
and I'm a murderer, a killer.

17
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,873
Mother always said
I'd come to a bad end.

18
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,634
What in Hades were
you doing here anyway?

19
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,834
I can't say that I've
seen you around here before.

20
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,113
If you're going to get yourself shot,
do it where you're known.

21
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,276
"Mr. Harry Worp, 87 Maple Avenue,
Boston, Massachusetts."

22
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,550
Well, Worp, you're
a long way from home.

23
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,678
By the looks of it, you won't
get back for Christmas.

24
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,394
We're going to have
a cold, hard winter.

25
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,791
You might keep here a long time,
an awful long time.

26
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,872
Too long for me, Harry.

27
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,280
Yes.

28
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,640
Captain Wiles.

29
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,314
Yes, ma'am?

30
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,992
What seems to be the trouble, Captain?

31
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,040
Well, it's what you might call
an unavoidable accident.

32
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,992
He's dead.

33
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,400
Yes.

34
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,800
I would say that he was. Of course,
that's an unprofessional opinion.

35
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:18,358
- Do you know him, Miss Gravely?
- No.

36
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,955
- Doesn't live around here.
- Well, he died around here.

37
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,315
That's what counts now.

38
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:26,593
Embarrassing. What do you plan
to do with him, Captain?

39
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,080
Miss Gravely,

40
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,280
without cutting the hem
off truth's garment,

41
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,149
I'm going to hide him.
Cover him up. Forget him.

42
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,598
Are you never going to
inform the police, Captain?

43
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,117
No. Forget you saw me, Miss Gravely.

44
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,398
Chase it out of your mind,
for heaven's sake. It was an accident.

45
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,679
He was poking around the clearing
and I thought he was a rabbit or something.

46
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,433
It was a human error.

47
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,637
Please, don't.

48
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,229
Don't say anything
to anybody, Miss Gravely.

49
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,229
Do as you think best, Captain.

50
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,472
I'm sure you must have met
many similar situations

51
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,517
in your travels in foreign lands.

52
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,831
Yeah, I've seen much worse things.

53
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,156
- I certainly won't say anything.
- Much worse things.

54
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,038
I remember when I was on the <i>Orinoco.</i>

55
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,830
We had a Turk, a great big Turk
there running amok with a machete.

56
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,913
Captain, if I were going to hide
an accident, I shouldn't delay.

57
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,717
You're right as rain, Miss Gravely.

58
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,760
Yes, you know something?
I'm glad I met you today.

59
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:41,076
I feel better for telling somebody as warm,
tender, understanding as yourself.

60
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:48,600
On the contrary, Captain, it...

61
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,918
I'm certainly glad
if I helped you, Captain.

62
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,277
Perhaps you would care to come over
for some blueberry muffins

63
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,794
and coffee later on.

64
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,758
High-bush blueberries.

65
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,150
This is certainly something
of an interesting surprise.

66
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,960
And perhaps a touch of elderberry wine.

67
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,196
After all, we've been neighbors
for nearly three years now

68
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,237
and we've never exchanged social calls.

69
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,159
You're right.
It's high time I paid a call.

70
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,475
What time?

71
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,280
Oh, say, early this afternoon?

72
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,149
I'll be there with a clean shirt
and a hungry face.

73
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,595
Do that.

74
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,634
You'd better be going along now.

75
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,640
You don't want to be
an accessory after the fact.

76
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,595
You are a considerate man,
Captain Wiles.

77
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,992
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

78
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,754
We're almost there, Mommy.

79
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,199
Here he is, Mommy, here he is.

80
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,639
- What did I tell you, Mommy?
- Don't touch it, Arnie.

81
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,200
There he is.

82
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,674
No, it can't be. Harry.

83
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,440
Harry. Thank Providence,
the last of Harry.

84
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,874
Who's Providence, Mommy?

85
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,271
- A very good friend.
- Don't you know who it is?

86
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,875
You said, "Harry."
Can't you remember, Arnie?

87
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,191
Why don't he get up and do something?

88
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,397
He's asleep.

89
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,116
He's in a deep sleep.
A deep, wonderful sleep.

90
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,237
How'd he hurt his head?

91
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,636
Putting it where it wasn't
wanted would be my guess.

92
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,796
Will it get better?

93
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,040
Not if we're lucky.

94
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,256
Let's run home and I'll make you
some lemonade.

95
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,591
Will lemonade put me in a wonderful,
deep, deep sleep, Mommy?

96
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,637
No, Arnie, but it's
better than no lemonade.

97
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,871
- I don't understand that.
- Never mind.

98
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,633
Now you just forget
you ever saw this man.

99
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,638
Is there a special way to forget?

100
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,776
Just think of something else.

101
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,031
I think I'll try not
to see him tomorrow, Mommy.

102
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,272
That's a good boy, Arnie. Now let's run
home and get that lemonade.

103
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,271
She won't care what I do with him.

104
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,555
Couldn't have had more people here
if I'd sold tickets.

105
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,596
What's the big attraction, I wonder.

106
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,633
This could turn out to be
the luckiest day of my life.

107
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,560
Might as well sit here till
the rest of the world comes by

108
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,040
to pay their last respects.

109
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,113
Sooner or later one of them has
to turn out to be the deputy sheriff.

110
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,235
<i>Flaggin' the train that's goin' home</i>

111
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,035
<i>Flaggin' the train to Tuscaloosa</i>

112
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,512
<i>Never no more, no more to roam</i>

113
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,910
<i>Gotta get back to Tuscaloosa</i>

114
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,640
<i>Got a sweet gal who's on my mind</i>

115
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,229
<i>Gotta get back to Tuscaloosa</i>

116
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,712
<i>Back to the gal I left behind</i>

117
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,200
<i>Got no baggage</i>

118
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,397
<i>Just got my fare</i>

119
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,120
<i>But all I need, yes, indeed</i>

120
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,999
<i>Is waitin' for me there</i>

121
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,549
<i>Flaggin' the train to Tuscaloosa</i>

122
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,996
<i>Oh, how I love that choo-choo sound</i>

123
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,390
<i>Flaggin' the train to Tuscaloosa</i>

124
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,952
<i>Flaggin' the train
that's homeward bound</i>

125
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,875
<i>Gotta get back to Tuscaloosa</i>

126
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,395
<i>Got a sweet gal who's on my mind</i>

127
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,830
<i>Gotta get back to Tuscaloosa</i>

128
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,755
<i>Back to the gal I left behind</i>

129
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,520
<i>Got no baggage</i>

130
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,671
<i>Just got my fare</i>

131
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,592
<i>But all I need, yes, indeed</i>

132
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,037
<i>Is waitin' for me there</i>

133
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,317
Hello, Mr. Marlow.

134
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,080
Wiggy, you haven't sold a painting.

135
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,356
All my pictures in the same place.

136
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,194
So few cars. They don't seem to...

137
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,755
- Guess the cider takes their attention.
- Cider?

138
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,911
Cider, indeed. Throw it away! Drink it!

139
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,673
No, I hate cider.

140
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,194
Not a picture sold.

141
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,671
I'm sorry, Mr. Marlow. Let's get a look
at your new one. Hold it up.

142
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,696
What good would it do to show it to you?
You don't deserve to see it.

143
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,836
How am I going to eat?

144
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,194
Mr. Wiggs always used to thump
his stomach when he got mad.

145
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,476
He busted something inside once.

146
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,277
You think we'd do any
better on Fifth Avenue?

147
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,352
If there's more people there.

148
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,672
Oh, lots of people. Hundreds and thousands
and billions of people.

149
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,439
Well, might be better then.

150
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,751
But what sort of people, Wiggy?
What breed?

151
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,674
I'll tell you. They're little people.

152
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,634
Little people with hats on.

153
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,359
How are your cigarettes?

154
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,071
I'll buy the other half tomorrow.

155
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,474
What does your son do with those
old cars he always works on?

156
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,313
He sells them. Mechanical antiques.

157
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,278
Doesn't make much,
but he needs the money.

158
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,392
Doesn't he get paid
for being deputy sheriff?

159
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,075
Piecework. Gets paid
by the arrest, I think.

160
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,997
Oh. Mr. Marlow, it's wonderful.

161
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,918
I've been in a tortured mood lately.

162
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,400
What is it?

163
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,359
Good old Wiggy, my sternest critic.

164
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,716
I don't understand your work.
I think it's beautiful.

165
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,519
So does Mrs. Rogers.

166
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,069
Oh! You talk about me?

167
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,976
She's the pretty woman
with the little boy, isn't she?

168
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Mmm-hmm.

169
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:09,074
I only brought up your name once
when we were talking about strange people.

170
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,389
Huh?

171
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,951
That is, strangers.
People she hadn't met yet.

172
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,715
And what does the pretty little thing
say about me?

173
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,315
Nothin'.

174
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:23,514
I think we better discuss business.
Now, my shopping list.

175
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,831
I'll go in and start puttin' it up.

176
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,554
Say, Wiggy, how do
you spell Tuscaloosa?

177
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,790
Sam?

178
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,995
Hi, Calvin.

179
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,117
- You hear any shootin' a while back?
- Nope.

180
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,238
Well, I did, and there shouldn't be
any shootin' around here.

181
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,080
- Why?
- It's posted land, that's why.

182
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,597
- Why's that?
- 'Cause I posted it.

183
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,976
What do you got against people doing
a little shooting now and then?

184
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,036
Let off a little steam.

185
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,920
Bullets and guns are dangerous.
They kill things.

186
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,994
No one around here could hit
a freight car with a cannon.

187
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,600
I guess you're right, Sam.

188
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,512
All the same the law's the law.

189
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,031
And I got a good mind to scout around,
find out who's doin' the shootin'

190
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,600
and level a little fine.

191
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,956
And pick up a little piecework?

192
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,999
If I can do anything to make it
any harder for you, let me know.

193
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,879
How do you want your bacon, Mr. Marlow?

194
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,956
- What were you saying?
- I asked how you want your bacon.

195
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,309
Sliced.

196
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,076
Where's Calvin?

197
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,311
Off somewheres unimportant.

198
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,313
What a wonderful day.

199
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,960
So was yesterday, but you didn't
say anything to me about it.

200
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,754
What you want Calvin for?

201
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,873
These marvelous pictures.

202
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,475
Someone told me they were yours.

203
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,517
Why don't you sell them,
make a lot of money?

204
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,896
Never thought of that.
Guess I'll just have to think about it.

205
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,310
And that song.
You sing it so beautifully.

206
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,232
You wrote it yourself, of course.

207
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,516
- What do you want to borrow?
- Oh, dear.

208
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,798
I just think people need encouragement
sometimes, don't you, Mr. Marlow?

209
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,112
- How do you know my name?
- Well, it's on the pictures, isn't it?

210
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,680
Not supposed to be readable.

211
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,274
You can tell it's not supposed to be.

212
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,757
They're very professional.
Don't you think, Mrs. Wiggs?

213
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,833
Well, Miss Gravely,
all I know is nobody buys them.

214
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,871
Thank you for your encouragement,
Miss Gravely.

215
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,952
I wonder how you know my name.

216
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,271
- Easy. Wiggy just said it.
- Wiggy.

217
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,955
What a perfectly
ridiculous little nickname.

218
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,475
Do you mind if I call
you "Wiggy," Mrs. Wiggs?

219
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,155
Not if you pay all your bills on time.

220
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,033
All right, Mr. Marlow.

221
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,954
Bacon, beans, cabbage, sugar, salt,

222
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:29,034
tea, oleo margarine. $1.95.

223
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,873
Don't forget half
a package of cigarettes.

224
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,959
- Oh, yes. Ten cents. $2.05.
- That much?

225
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,195
Don't seem to be able to find...

226
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,512
I know, Mr. Marlow. As soon
as we sell some of your paintings.

227
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,834
Just a minute, Mr. Marlow.

228
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,720
Let me make my position clear.

229
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,870
What do you think?

230
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,512
I think it'll hold coffee.

231
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,512
Would you try it, Mr. Marlow?

232
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,830
Put your finger through
the handle, please.

233
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,875
How about the size?
What about the handle?

234
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,120
Hmm?

235
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,235
I mean, does it fit?
Is it the right finger size?

236
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,959
It's my finger size.

237
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,036
I'll take it.

238
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,759
Fifteen cents.

239
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,479
- And the saucer?
- Ten.

240
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,392
That seems a fair price.

241
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,631
What's the finger size
got to do with it?

242
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,872
Um... I wanted to be certain
it would fit a man.

243
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,198
- A certain size man.
- A man?

244
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:04,194
A certain somebody is coming over
to my cottage this afternoon.

245
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,475
Not really?

246
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,552
For coffee and blueberry muffins.

247
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,797
Why, you old social butterfly, you.

248
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,595
Old?

249
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,751
That was figuratively
speaking, Miss Gravely.

250
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,479
Think we've got
a nearsighted cider customer.

251
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,911
How old do you think I am, young man?

252
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,430
Mmm...

253
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,918
Fifty. How old do you think you are?

254
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,798
Forty-two.

255
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,837
I can show you my birth certificate.

256
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,216
I'm afraid you're gonna
have to show more

257
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,755
than your birth certificate
to convince a man of that.

258
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,840
What do you mean?

259
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,752
I mean you have to show your character.

260
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,117
The inner self. The hidden qualities.

261
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,318
The true Miss Gravely,
sensitive, young in feeling,

262
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,199
timeless with love and understanding.

263
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,159
I can do it.

264
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,357
At least I think I can do it.

265
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,440
Do what?

266
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,616
Well, I think I'll just go out
and see what that gentleman wants.

267
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,552
At a time like this?
Where are your scissors?

268
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,270
- Outside.
- We're going to cut her hair.

269
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,999
- Hair?
- Cut it short.

270
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,710
Bring it up to date.
Make a nice romantic styling.

271
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,712
Take ten years off
your birth certificate.

272
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,950
How are you fixed for ribbon?

273
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,474
Should be some around somewhere.

274
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,751
- Powder, rouge, lipstick?
- I think so.

275
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,594
Nothing cheap, shoddy or obvious.

276
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,991
Just youth, gentility, character.

277
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,715
I'll go out and get the scissors.
You find the other things.

278
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,673
- Ah! Here they are.
- Excuse me, young man, I...

279
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,910
Oh, well.

280
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,036
All right, Ernest, let's go.

281
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,117
Well, always grow back, I guess.

282
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:13,511
- There's Calvin.
- Is he alone?

283
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,876
Yep. Guess he didn't sell his car.

284
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,280
Hey. Would you mind
getting out of my picture?

285
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,799
Next thing you know,
they'll be televising the whole thing.

286
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,840
Uh...

287
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,275
- This your body, little man?
- Oh, don't turn me in.

288
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,920
It was an accident, an accident,
pure and simple.

289
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,080
I thought he was a rabbit
or a pheasant or something.

290
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,799
It could have happened to you.

291
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,496
Suppose we straighten
this whole thing out?

292
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,751
Well, I guess that's the only way out.

293
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,395
First thing I seen
when I rolled out this morning

294
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,080
was a double-breasted robin,
drunk as a hoot owl

295
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,436
from eating fermented chokecherries.

296
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,671
Right away I knew
somebody was in trouble.

297
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,798
What I didn't know was that it was me.

298
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,115
Well, the larder was empty,

299
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,440
and I got to thinking
about a toothful of fried rabbit...

300
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,791
Stands to reason they
can't touch you for it.

301
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,556
Nothing these days stands to reason.

302
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,711
It was accidental,
an act of God, perhaps.

303
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,880
In a way you should be grateful
that you were able to do your share

304
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,351
in accomplishing
the destiny of a fellow being.

305
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,279
Suppose, for instance,
it was written in the Book of Heaven

306
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:41,398
that this man was to die
at this particular time

307
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,392
at this particular place.

308
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,836
And suppose for a moment the actual

309
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,674
accomplishing of his departure
had been bungled.

310
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,673
Something gone wrong. Uh...

311
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,672
Perhaps it was meant
to be a thunderbolt

312
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,956
and there was no thunder
available, say.

313
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,680
Then you come along, and you shoot him

314
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:03,915
and heaven's will is done
and destiny fulfilled.

315
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,229
Your conscience is quite clear.

316
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,834
You got nothing to worry about.

317
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,754
Sammy, I haven't got a conscience

318
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,672
and it's not heaven that's worrying me

319
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,752
'cause I don't expect
I'll ever have to face it.

320
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,320
And it's none of those noble things
you were talking about, no.

321
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,155
Nothing like that.

322
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,993
Then what is it?

323
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,800
It's me. It's me that's worrying me.

324
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,520
Me and my future life.

325
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,916
I know the police
and their suspicious ways.

326
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,037
You're guilty until
you're proved innocent.

327
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,191
I want nothing more to do with them.

328
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,237
Bury him, I say,
and have done with him.

329
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,551
He's no good to anyone now.

330
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,953
Lay him to rest.
Put him under the sod. Forget him.

331
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,635
I never did it, and you never saw him.

332
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,696
Yes, what about all those
other people who saw him?

333
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,473
How about the woman and the little boy?

334
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,631
Miss Gravely and the tramp

335
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,757
and the man who was reading
the book, Dr. Greenbow.

336
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,157
How about all of them?

337
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,476
Nobody was interested, I tell you.

338
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,711
Nobody ever cared until you came along.

339
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,354
Ah. That's what you think.

340
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,239
Suppose someone starts to care
after you've buried him.

341
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,358
I can't wait for people to start
caring whenever they feel like it.

342
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,000
I don't want a little accident
to turn into a career.

343
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,912
Suppose that woman
who called him Harry.

344
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,231
Suppose she decides
she loves him after all.

345
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,631
She was downright
hysterical with delight.

346
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,836
What was she like?

347
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:21,391
Pretty as a rainbow.
Wish I was two years younger.

348
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,240
- And with a little boy?
- About four or five years of age.

349
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,158
It's got to be Mrs. Rogers and her son.

350
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,720
Sammy,

351
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,077
what do you say we slip him underground now
that you've finished drawing him? Eh?

352
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,675
We could discuss
the smaller details later.

353
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,000
I don't like it.

354
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,356
The authorities like
to know when people die.

355
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:43,391
All right, Sammy. Forget it.

356
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,876
You cut off home.

357
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,350
I killed him, and I'll
look after his remains.

358
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:52,036
What will you do, drag him around
the countryside the rest of the day?

359
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,278
I'll do my best.
That's all a man can do.

360
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,398
If you're not careful, you will get
a murder charge lined up.

361
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,790
Matter of fact, I'm beginning
to suspect something myself.

362
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,519
There you are then. See?

363
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,398
If you, an artist, suspect the worst,

364
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,120
what are they, the police,
going to think?

365
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,550
What about that envelope
with his name and address on it?

366
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,155
By rights you should
mail him back home.

367
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,880
Sammy, have you forgotten

368
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,038
who carries the mail
down to the station every night?

369
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:21,039
Calvin Wiggs, deputy sheriff.

370
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,237
Yes, you're right.

371
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,471
Tell you what we'll do.

372
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,153
Tell you what.

373
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,755
We'll find out how well
Mrs. Rogers knows this man

374
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,480
and whether she intends to notify
the police of his death.

375
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,512
What good will that do?

376
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,000
A lot of good.

377
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,833
If she's just a distant friend of his

378
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,389
who doesn't intend
to notify the authorities,

379
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,039
then I personally
will help you bury Harry.

380
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,912
Oh, Sammy, you've signed on
for the cruise.

381
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,314
What time is it?

382
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,672
- About noon.
- Good heavens!

383
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,056
I've got to go home and spruce up.

384
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,400
I've got a date with Miss Gravely.

385
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,031
Not you?

386
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,315
You're not the one.

387
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,352
Oh, Sam, she could do
a lot worse, you know.

388
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,238
Couldn't do any better.

389
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,358
Just think, you'll be
establishing a precedent.

390
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,432
I'm not establishing nothing.

391
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,752
I'm going over for some
blueberry muffins and coffee

392
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,832
by her own invitation.

393
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,554
And, possibly, some elderberry wine.

394
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:27,190
Do you realize that
you'll be the first man to

395
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,879
cross her threshold?

396
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,320
Hmm.

397
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:34,630
It's not too late, you know.

398
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,951
She's a well-preserved woman.

399
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:40,391
- I envy you.
- Yes. Very well-preserved.

400
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,996
And preserves have
to be opened someday.

401
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,510
Yes. You just trot down
and see what Mrs. Rogers has to say.

402
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,678
- How about hiding Harry first.
- Holy smoke!

403
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,912
Forgetting a little detail
like that could hang a man.

404
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,712
Oh, I beg your pardon.

405
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:51,477
I hope I never have to be
operated on by Dr. Greenbow.

406
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,392
- Come on. Let's get going.
- Yeah.

407
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,480
Good afternoon.

408
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,195
You're beautiful, wonderful.

409
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,636
You're the most wonderful,
beautiful thing I've ever seen.

410
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,677
I'd like to paint you.

411
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:09,516
Is there something else you wanted,
Mr. Marlow, isn't it?

412
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:14,433
You certainly are a lovely woman.
I'd like to paint you nude.

413
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:18,150
Some other time, Mr. Marlow.
I was about to make Arnie some lemonade.

414
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,038
Oh, yes, yes, of course.

415
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,117
Perhaps I've come at an awkward moment.

416
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,034
If you want to undress me, you have.

417
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:28,238
It wasn't exactly that. I came here
to talk to you about something

418
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,119
but after I saw you,
it slipped my mind.

419
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,835
- Couldn't have been very important, then.
- Yes, you're right.

420
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,152
Why don't you sit down on the porch?

421
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,550
I'll get you a lemonade,
and maybe you'll think of it.

422
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,195
You're not only beautiful,
you're considerate, too.

423
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,510
- Arnie!
- Hello, Mr. Marlow.

424
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,637
Hi. What have you got? A rabbit?

425
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,672
Dead. What have you got?

426
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,760
Oh!

427
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,640
I got me a little frog.

428
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,640
There he is.

429
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,717
It's hungry. It needs a mother.

430
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,040
- I'll trade ya.
- Your mother for mine?

431
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,680
- The rabbit for the frog.
- It's yours, Arnie.

432
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,517
I think you got the best deal.

433
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,512
Dead rabbits don't eat.

434
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,638
I'll just take it in the kitchen
and give him some lemonade.

435
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,555
Four rabbits' feet, and he got killed.

436
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,280
He should have carried
a four-leaf clover, too.

437
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,238
And a horseshoe.

438
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,880
Say, how do rabbits get to be born?

439
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,680
- Same way elephants do.
- Oh, sure.

440
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,639
How come you never came over
to visit me before?

441
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,632
Didn't know you had
such a pretty mother, Arnie.

442
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,000
If you think she's pretty,
you should see my slingshot.

443
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,837
- Hmm. Perhaps I'll come back tomorrow.
- When's that?

444
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,320
Day after today.

445
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,750
That's yesterday. Today's tomorrow.

446
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,920
It was?

447
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,795
When was tomorrow yesterday,
Mr. Marlow?

448
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,798
- Today.
- Oh, sure. Yesterday.

449
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,839
You'll never make sense out of Arnie.
He's got his own timing.

450
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,154
- Lemonade, Arnie?
- I already swiped two glasses.

451
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:28,551
- I would have given you two glasses.
- It's more fun swiped.

452
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,319
- Can I borrow your rabbit, Mr. Marlow?
- Sure, Arnie.

453
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,720
What are you gonna do with it?

454
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,395
You never know when
a dead rabbit might come in handy.

455
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,110
It already got me one frog.

456
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,760
Arnie, where you going now?

457
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,116
To make some more trades.

458
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,115
- Arnie, come home in time for supper.
- I'll try.

459
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,159
What's your given name? If you don't want
to tell me, just make one up.

460
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,758
Jennifer. Jennifer Rogers.

461
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,115
Nice.

462
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,240
Um...

463
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,551
Who's the man up on the path?

464
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,878
- What man?
- You know, Harry, the dead man.

465
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:16,873
Oh, him. That's my husband.

466
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,992
Your husband's dead, then?

467
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,799
Is your lemonade sweet enough?

468
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,951
- Seems to be.
- I like it tart.

469
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,392
Harry is Arnie's father then?

470
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,676
- No, Arnie's father's dead.
- So is Harry.

471
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,479
Thank goodness.
He was too good to live.

472
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,359
From his looks, he didn't appear
to be the kind that was "too good."

473
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,955
Well, he was. Horribly good.

474
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,032
I like your mouth, too.

475
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,555
Especially when you say "good."

476
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,351
- Will you have some more lemonade?
- Maybe later. Thanks.

477
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,432
Where'd Arnie get the rabbit?

478
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:01,511
He found it. I think
Captain Wiles shot it.

479
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,638
I'd like to hear more of your life story,
if you don't mind.

480
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,760
You see, we don't know
quite what to do with Harry.

481
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,150
Thought you might
have some suggestions.

482
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,391
You can stuff him, for all I care.

483
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,476
Stuff him and put him in a glass case.

484
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,394
Only I'd suggest frosted glass.

485
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,954
What did he do to you,
besides marry you?

486
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:30,913
Look. I've wanted to explain
about Harry a lot of times.

487
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,755
Nobody would understand,
least of all Harry.

488
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,711
But you, you've got an artistic mind.

489
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,598
You can see the finer things.

490
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,479
When I'm lucky. Go on.
Tell me everything.

491
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,153
Let it all out.

492
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,917
It was a long time ago,
and I was in love.

493
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,469
- I was too much in love.
- What was his name?

494
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,273
Robert.

495
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:59,637
We'd agreed to overlook each other's families
and everything and get married.

496
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,120
Did you?

497
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,554
Oh, yes.

498
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,718
And then Robert got killed.

499
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,800
Oh?

500
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,638
I was heartbroken

501
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:14,749
for six weeks, and then I discovered
little Arnie was on the way.

502
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:18,470
- Must have been a shock.
- That's where Harry came in.

503
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,230
Harry the handsome hero.

504
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,358
Harry the saint. Harry the good.

505
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,154
- I didn't catch his last name.
- Harry Worp.

506
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,038
Robert's brother. His older brother.

507
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,157
And he fell in love with you?

508
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:34,358
If he'd fallen in love with me,
I wouldn't have minded.

509
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,717
He wanted to marry me because
he was Robert's brother and felt noble.

510
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,360
But you thought he was
in love with you.

511
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,394
And I decided to let him
love me because of Arnie.

512
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,200
It was on my second wedding night
that I learned the truth.

513
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,794
You didn't learn on your first?

514
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:57,078
This was a terrible truth.

515
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,231
The truth about Harry.

516
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,800
Just what happened?

517
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,312
How old are you, Mr. Marlow?

518
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,070
About thirty.

519
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,237
This is what happened.

520
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,915
I was in the hotel room alone.

521
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,834
I put on my best nightie.
You understand?

522
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,760
Perfectly.

523
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,231
Although I had
no true feeling for Harry,

524
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,437
I had worked myself
into a certain enthusiasm

525
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,591
because I thought he loved me.

526
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,878
Must have been hard work.

527
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,759
There was a full moon,
and I sat by the window

528
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,912
because I thought it would show off
my new nightie to advantage.

529
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,073
Naturally.

530
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,631
I don't know why
I'm telling you all this.

531
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:47,839
You, a perfect stranger, too.
I'm not boring you, am I?

532
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,280
No, no, not at all.

533
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,111
- How about some more lemonade?
- Soon.

534
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,153
Where was I?

535
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,110
You were sitting by the window
because it was a full moon

536
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,920
and you'd worked yourself up
to a certain enthusiasm?

537
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,677
I said all that?

538
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,797
When does Harry come in?

539
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,955
He doesn't. He never came in.

540
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,191
He called the following morning.

541
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,511
The following morning?

542
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,638
In the hotel lobby the night before,
he had bought a magazine.

543
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,076
- His horoscope was in it.
- Bad?

544
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,036
It said... He was a Taurus.

545
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:28,079
It said, "Don't start
any new project that day.

546
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,630
"It could never be finished."

547
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,915
And what did you do?

548
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,913
I left him on the spot
and went home to Mother's.

549
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,195
The end.

550
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,352
What a poignant story.

551
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,592
I knew you'd understand.
Nobody else does.

552
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,796
Not even Mother?

553
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,759
Well, she thought I should live
with him, but I wouldn't.

554
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:50,516
He pestered me to go back,
but I always refused.

555
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,991
Suppose some night
I wanted him to do something.

556
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,549
Like the dishes, for example.

557
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,597
His horoscope just wouldn't let him.

558
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,194
You're absolutely right.

559
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:03,717
There are some things I just
don't like to do by myself.

560
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,793
And no one with any true understanding
would blame you for it.

561
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,919
Soon as Arnie was born

562
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,281
I moved away to where I thought
Harry could never find me.

563
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,955
I changed my name and...

564
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:19,192
But he was persistent?

565
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,357
This morning there was a knock
on the door.

566
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,353
Before I opened it, I knew
he was standing on the other side.

567
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:27,035
- What did he want?
- Me.

568
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,840
He wanted me because I was his wife.

569
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,310
He wanted me because,
as he put it, he suddenly felt

570
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,120
some basic urge. Loneliness.

571
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,555
What did you feel?

572
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,233
I felt sick.

573
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,437
Did you see his mustache
and his wavy hair?

574
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,193
When I saw him, he was dead.

575
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:46,035
He looked the same when he was alive,
except he was vertical.

576
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,680
So he entered. What did you say?

577
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,798
Nothing. I hit him over the head
with a milk bottle and knocked him silly.

578
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:53,680
Silly?

579
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,637
Bats. Tappy.

580
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,752
He went staggering up towards the woods

581
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:01,833
saying he was gonna find his wife
and drag her home if it killed him.

582
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:03,916
Apparently it did.

583
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,956
Have some more lemonade.

584
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,992
Why, Captain Wiles, what a surprise.

585
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,276
But you invited me, Miss Gravely.

586
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,113
At least, that's how I remember it.

587
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:02,950
Of course I did, Captain,
but somehow it's still a surprise.

588
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,596
Yeah.

589
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,149
You certainly know
how to make a man feel wanted.

590
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,994
Won't you come in, Captain?

591
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:13,915
Thank you. I've looked forward to it.

592
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:32,674
Takes a real cook to make
a good blueberry muffin

593
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,760
to keep the blueberries
from sitting on the bottom.

594
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,560
High-bush blueberries.

595
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,233
That's the secret.

596
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:43,435
I picked them up near where you shot
that unfortunate man.

597
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:51,000
A real, handsome, man's cup.

598
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,715
It's been in the family for years.

599
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,032
My father always used it,
up until he died.

600
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,512
I trust he died peacefully,
slipped away in the night?

601
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,592
He was caught in a threshing machine.

602
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,557
I hope I haven't
distressed you, Captain.

603
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,791
Not at all, Miss Gravely. Not at all.

604
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,873
I'm used to looking
on the rough side of things.

605
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:20,156
I'm a man who's faced death many times.

606
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:22,869
Rather recently, too.

607
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,630
Yes.

608
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,077
Arnie, what are you carrying there?

609
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,276
A rabbit.

610
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,510
A rabbit?

611
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,518
- What do you call it?
- Dead.

612
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,557
- It ain't mine.
- Whose is it?

613
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:44,360
Yours. You shot it with your gun.

614
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:46,477
You must have killed it today.

615
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,656
It should make a nice stew for you.

616
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:50,400
A rabbit! I finally killed a rabbit!

617
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,951
- Where did you find it?
- In the blueberry muffins.

618
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,960
- What?
- Out in the woods.

619
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,759
Here you are. One muffin for one rabbit.
Fair enough?

620
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:05,278
That was a two-muffin rabbit.

621
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,352
- I gotta go now.
- Oh.

622
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,040
Mmm...

623
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:24,637
It's certainly a nice
afternoon, Miss Gravely.

624
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,035
Isn't it.

625
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:31,800
Yes, and you're a nice woman.

626
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:36,352
And I think you're awfully nice,
Captain Wiles.

627
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:40,754
Um... Let's get back
to our little problem. Harry.

628
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,035
What's going to become of him?

629
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,998
Oh, now, now,
don't you worry about Harry.

630
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:46,356
He'll be comfortably
underground before nightfall.

631
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,957
All that digging and work.

632
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:53,159
Couldn't you just let him slide
off the end of your boat pier

633
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,799
into the pond?

634
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:58,032
And have him pop up like a cork?

635
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:01,955
No, sir. Nobody ever popped up
from under four feet of ground.

636
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,837
No. Besides, they'll be cutting ice
there this winter.

637
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,639
Now, wouldn't it be a nice thing

638
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,136
if they were cutting
blocks of ice and...

639
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,914
Never mind, Captain. You're right.

640
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,037
Yes, underground
is the best place for Harry.

641
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:45,791
He seems comfortable, Sam.
Very comfortable and snug.

642
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,634
We'd better find a place and
get it dug, and the sooner the better.

643
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,480
If what you're telling me about Mrs. Rogers
and her husband is right,

644
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:52,880
I agree with you, Sammy.

645
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,680
Let's find a place.

646
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,558
No use making hard work out of it.

647
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,518
We need a place where
the earth is soft.

648
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:05,198
Yeah, and a place where the whole town
won't stumble over us as we work.

649
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,397
A place with a certain character
and attractiveness.

650
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:10,837
Facing west, so that Harry
can watch the setting sun.

651
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,431
- Where it'll be cozy in winter.
- And cool in the summer.

652
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:17,831
You know, I'm half envying Harry.

653
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:20,998
Wouldn't take much longer
to dig it twice as wide.

654
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:24,517
Thanks for your kindness,
but some other time.

655
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,235
- This looks like a good place.
- Ah!

656
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,312
You're a lucky fellow, Harry Worp.

657
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,995
- Come on, Captain, off with your coat.
- Who, me?

658
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,112
Certainly you.
It's your body, isn't it?

659
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,237
I'm not much of a hand
at grave-digging.

660
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:50,080
You should have thought of that
before you went hunting this morning.

661
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,673
Calvin Wiggs. What do we do now?

662
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,276
Think up the best story
he's ever heard.

663
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,475
Lay down your shovel, Sam.

664
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:27,676
What's the trouble?

665
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,080
I'm dead beat.

666
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,990
Good. I was dead beat ten minutes ago.

667
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:35,515
I wanted to keep digging
until you gave up.

668
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,674
Gives me the creeps.

669
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,912
What? Come on.
Let's get Harry and pop him in.

670
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,432
With hasty reverence.

671
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:07,151
Would you like to say
a few words, Captain?

672
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:11,996
That I would. Harry Worp, don't ever
show your face around here again.

673
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:19,440
Let's finish this job
and get out of here.

674
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:23,400
Captain, I think Calvin Wiggs is
looking for something.

675
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,358
Suppose he knows
Harry Worp came up here?

676
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,672
Sammy, that's as horrible
a thought as you've ever had.

677
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:31,041
And that he wonders what happened
to Harry or where he is?

678
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:35,757
My only answer is to keep on scraping,
and fast.

679
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:38,520
You know, if you must kill things
from now on,

680
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:39,829
I wish you'd stick to rabbits.

681
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,070
The body's smaller.

682
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:42,833
Rabbits! I didn't tell you,
did I, Sammy?

683
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,593
I shot a rabbit today!

684
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:47,320
Don't shout. I know you did.

685
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,399
I was up at Jennifer Rogers'
when Arnie showed me the rabbit.

686
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:54,190
Jennifer, eh?
Didn't waste much time, did you?

687
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,118
Well, I don't blame you, Sammy.

688
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,880
A very nice widow
she'll make. Very nice.

689
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,191
Let's discuss her
when we've finished with Harry.

690
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,114
Oh, no need to get huffy.
I don't want to talk about your affairs.

691
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:06,396
I've got affairs of my own.

692
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,392
You mean my protégée?

693
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,711
- Come again?
- Miss Gravely.

694
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:14,032
The lady that I renovated down
at Mrs. Wiggs' this afternoon.

695
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:16,999
A most remarkable
reversion to femininity.

696
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:19,390
I don't quite get you, Sammy boy.

697
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:22,120
She came into the emporium
in rather high excitement.

698
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:25,238
Wanted a new cup and saucer,
lots of other things.

699
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:28,757
I gave her a new makeup and hairdo.

700
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,079
Don't tell me you didn't notice.

701
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:32,958
She's a very nice lady, Sam.

702
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,600
- Very nice.
- We're all nice.

703
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,639
I don't see how anyone
could help but like us.

704
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,234
That's just how I feel today.

705
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:42,915
I don't know whether I've grown
rose-colored glasses or if...

706
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,719
Or if you're in love?

707
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:46,639
Ah...

708
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:50,032
There's nothing like
finding yourself in love.

709
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:52,635
No, it adds zest to your work.

710
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,120
Zest. Zest.

711
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,435
I think I've had
enough zest for a while.

712
00:51:58,520 --> 00:51:59,954
Let's sit down and rest, huh?

713
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:02,555
Why not? We've earned it.

714
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:10,514
Tell me, Sam, what did Jennifer think
of my shooting?

715
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,200
- You mean Mrs. Rogers?
- Oh, I think by now I'm entitled

716
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,839
to be on a first-name basis with her.

717
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:17,754
After all, I brought her a happy release
with one bullet.

718
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:20,799
One bullet? How 'bout that
"No Shooting" sign that I found?

719
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,873
Oh, well, that. One bullet
for the "No Shooting" sign,

720
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:26,794
one for the beer can and one for Harry.

721
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,554
- How about the rabbit?
- And one for the...

722
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,637
What's the matter?

723
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:40,071
- What's wrong? What's bitten you?
- I only fired three bullets.

724
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:43,836
Three. One for the shooting sign,
one for the beer can...

725
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,151
And one for the little man
who's lying in the grave.

726
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,914
No, Sammy, no. That's just it.
One for the rabbit.

727
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,310
If I shot the rabbit,
I didn't shoot Harry.

728
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:54,552
Oh, Sammy boy, what have you tried
to make me do?

729
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,393
Tried to make a murderer out of me.

730
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:03,510
Don't sit there. Help me!
You helped bury him.

731
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,216
Even if you didn't kill him,
why go digging him up

732
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:07,357
now that he's so beautifully planted?

733
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,035
I've promised Jennifer
that we'd bury him.

734
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,918
Keep my word, he should stay buried.

735
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:15,960
Besides, whether you killed him or not,
you've incriminated yourself.

736
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:20,276
You'll have much more of a job explaining
a body you didn't kill and buried

737
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:23,473
than a body that
you killed accidentally and buried.

738
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:24,676
Right, Captain?

739
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,056
You're not supposed to bury bodies
whenever you find them.

740
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,753
It makes people suspicious.

741
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:37,197
Supposed to tell the police
or advertise or something.

742
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,919
Oh, Sammy, you don't understand.

743
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,037
You don't comprehend one little bit.

744
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,640
You wouldn't like me to go through life

745
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,640
not knowing if I've killed him
or not, would you?

746
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:51,316
Very inconsistent. First you tell me
you've got no conscience.

747
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,201
Now you talk about something
that sounds remarkably like a conscience.

748
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:56,239
Sammy, come on. Help me.

749
00:53:56,320 --> 00:54:00,712
I don't care if I killed him or not,
for all that matters, but I'll get the shakes

750
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:04,516
whenever I see a policeman,
and it's no good saying I won't.

751
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,391
All right. If I had my choice

752
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:10,234
I'd rather be thought
a murderer than proved one.

753
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,320
Thank you, Sam.

754
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:14,637
With two of us digging, we'll have Harry up
out of here in nothing flat.

755
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:26,560
Can't see much from here. I'd better get
in down there and look at him.

756
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,074
Let me do the honors, Captain.

757
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,351
All right, Sammy, you've got good eyes.

758
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:37,436
- That isn't a bullet wound.
- "Isn't a bullet wound"?

759
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,512
Well, what do you know.

760
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:42,434
That's what they call a blow
with a blunt instrument.

761
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:43,520
Huh?

762
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,400
What are you thinking, Sammy?

763
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:50,954
I think, Captain Wiles,
we're tangled up in a murder.

764
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,873
If it's murder, who done it?

765
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,798
- Who "did" it?
- That's what I say, who done it?

766
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:02,351
Apart from Jennifer Rogers,
who else would want to kill him?

767
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:06,075
- "Apart from Jennifer"?
- Yeah.

768
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:09,517
- Do you think that she would...
- That's ridiculous.

769
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:12,240
You said she was surprised to see the body
when she came up here.

770
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:14,755
You said she hit him on the head.

771
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,270
Coming home from Madagascar once,
we had a fireman on board

772
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:20,239
who hit his head on a brick wall
and died two days later.

773
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,711
Where could he find a brick wall
on board a ship?

774
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,873
Mmm. That's what we always wondered.

775
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:30,834
Couldn't have been Jennifer. No.

776
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:33,196
Besides, what's it matter who did it?

777
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,840
It'll be better for all of us
if he's buried and out of the way.

778
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:39,880
Nothing doing, Sammy. I'm not burying
someone else's bad habits.

779
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,550
- Mmm? Suppose it was Miss Gravely?
- What?

780
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,720
No, it's not as funny as all that.

781
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,996
You said yourself
she wasn't particularly startled

782
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:52,719
to see you dragging Harry up the path.

783
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,838
You artists have
got no idea of etiquette.

784
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,435
Miss Gravely is a lady of
gentle habits and upbringing.

785
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:02,036
A lady to hide her feelings. If I hadn't
been holding Harry by the ankles

786
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:03,736
I don't suppose
she'd have mentioned him at all.

787
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:04,910
Really?

788
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:09,597
When she said,
"What seems to be the trouble, Captain?"

789
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:12,076
it was nothing more
than a pleasantry, so to speak.

790
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:16,951
Like, "Nice day, isn't it?"
"I'm sure, yes."

791
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:20,790
- Yes, or something like that.
- Going to help me bury him again?

792
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,109
Mmm...

793
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,476
I don't know.

794
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:27,992
Course, it might have been Dr. Greenbow
or the tramp or...

795
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:32,233
- Or Jennifer?
- I told you it couldn't...

796
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:37,592
No point in arguing about it.
Let's get rid of him.

797
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:40,235
All right, Sammy. You've helped me
in my hour of need.

798
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:42,676
I guess it's up to me to help you.

799
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:45,554
- We'll file Harry away once and for all.
- Yeah.

800
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:47,711
No more nonsense about it.

801
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:16,033
Come aboard, Miss Gravely. Come aboard.

802
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,675
It's just an old salt's snug anchorage.

803
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:22,555
Small. Not palatial like yours.
But homely, very home...

804
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:42,351
- Won't you sit down, Miss Gravely?
- Thank you.

805
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:49,911
It's funny, you know. Funny how we got to be
so friendly in one afternoon.

806
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,119
I knew you weren't as prim
and starchy as they made out.

807
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,311
Not by a long shot.

808
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,278
- Really?
- No.

809
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:01,797
I'm a man who can recognize
the human qualities in a woman.

810
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:03,997
When I first saw you
down where Harry was...

811
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,390
- Captain Wiles.
- Yes, ma'am?

812
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,995
Before you make your
kind thoughts known to me,

813
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:13,472
I should like to offer you some explanation
of my sudden invitation

814
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:16,234
to coffee and blueberry muffins
this afternoon

815
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:19,199
and my... And my sitting
with you here now.

816
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:21,556
No, ma'am, you don't
have to explain anything.

817
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:25,714
You came to my aid at a moment of crisis,
for which I'm truly grateful.

818
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:30,194
Thank you, but it's just
that I owe you some reason...

819
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:32,556
No, no, no. I won't hear a word of it.

820
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:35,991
You saw the predicament I was
in with that body on my hands and all,

821
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:39,835
and you shut your eyes to it in
a most sporting fashion, if I may say so.

822
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:42,116
- Captain Wiles.
- Yes, ma'am?

823
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,920
I'm trying to tell you
that the reason that I asked you

824
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,269
to coffee and blueberry muffins

825
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,710
was because I felt...

826
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,917
- Sympathy.
- Gratitude.

827
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:54,155
But I'm the one who should be grateful.

828
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:58,120
No, I was grateful. I am grateful.

829
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:03,194
I'm grateful to you
for burying my body.

830
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:10,433
Your body?

831
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:13,110
The man you thought you killed

832
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,192
was the man I hit over the head

833
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:17,551
with the leather heel
of my hiking shoe.

834
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:18,869
You?

835
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:23,190
- And with a metal cleat on the end of it.
- But why?

836
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:26,918
He annoyed me.

837
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:30,795
I was walking towards home
when he suddenly came at me

838
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:35,551
with a wild look in his eye
and insisted we were married.

839
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:37,996
Then you'd known each other before.

840
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:41,198
Believe it or not, Captain,
I had never seen him before in my life,

841
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:45,035
and if I ever had,
I never would have married him.

842
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:47,597
He must have mistaken you
for someone else.

843
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:51,674
No, he very definitely
pulled me into the bushes.

844
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:55,514
- Yes?
- I came out again.

845
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:00,359
- Go on.
- He pulled me back.

846
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:04,395
- Twice.
- He swore at me...

847
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:07,598
Horrible, masculine sounds.

848
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:11,111
- I didn't understand them, of course.
- Of course. Of course you didn't.

849
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:15,040
- We fought.
- Then what?

850
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:20,991
I won. My shoe had come off
in the struggle, and I hit him.

851
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:25,040
I hit him as hard as ever I could.

852
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,118
You killed him.

853
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:35,759
I must have done it.
I was annoyed, Captain.

854
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:39,071
- Very annoyed.
- Naturally.

855
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:42,437
I don't think I've ever
been so annoyed.

856
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:47,390
Consequently, I...
I didn't realize my own capabilities.

857
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:50,751
Seems to me

858
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:53,912
Mrs. Rogers knocked him silly,
and you finished him off.

859
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,996
Why should Mrs. Rogers knock him silly?

860
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:59,311
She was really his wife.

861
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:02,757
Poor woman. I thought
she had better taste.

862
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:07,672
You know, Captain,

863
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:11,754
when I ran away I decided I would
never tell a soul what had happened.

864
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:14,470
Then I met you, and I thought

865
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:19,791
how convenient it was that you should
think that you had shot him.

866
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:23,311
- You must forgive me for thinking that.
- Only natural.

867
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:27,952
That's why I felt...
I still feel under an obligation to you.

868
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:30,595
Not at all. Let's forget it.

869
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:33,878
No, we mustn't do that.
It would hardly be fair to you...

870
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,356
I mean, for you to go through life

871
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:39,990
knowing that you had
buried a man you didn't kill.

872
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:42,515
You would have my crime
on your conscience.

873
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:45,559
It's a pleasure, I'm sure.

874
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,798
No.

875
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:51,760
Now I realize that
Harry man was out of his mind

876
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:55,470
and my action was justifiable, there's...
There's no reason

877
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:57,517
we shouldn't let the authorities
know about it.

878
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:01,316
- The authorities?
- Everything will be cleared up nicely.

879
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:06,759
I'm sure Calvin Wiggs and the police
won't make a fuss about it when we explain.

880
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:08,832
Perhaps it needn't get
into the papers at all.

881
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:12,630
Don't you believe it, ma'am. They love it,
the papers, this kind of thing.

882
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:15,235
Murder and passion.

883
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:17,915
You let Harry be.
Just forget it ever happened,

884
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,676
the same as Sammy and me
and Jennifer Rogers are going to do.

885
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:26,477
Oh, but it isn't your body.

886
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:31,077
After all, I killed him, so it's
only fair that I should have the say-so.

887
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:32,480
- Yes, but...
- Don't you agree?

888
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:34,671
- Well, in a way...
- I thought you would.

889
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:36,752
I tell you what, Captain.

890
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,597
- We'll go and get a spade now.
- But, ma'am...

891
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:45,320
And after we've dug him up,
we'll go back to my place

892
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:48,234
and I'll make you some hot chocolate.

893
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:31,677
Arnie's so tired, he'll sleep
all day and half the night.

894
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:34,475
I think you've got
a pretty house, Jennifer.

895
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:37,280
The best I could do
on Robert's insurance.

896
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:40,074
- Sugar?
- No. Black, thanks.

897
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:56,393
It's funny, but I feel awful comfortable
with you, Sam.

898
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,996
You know, I feel the same way, too.

899
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:03,072
It's a good feeling,

900
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:06,870
feeling comfortable with someone
who feels that way, too.

901
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:13,029
There is one thing
I feel uncomfortable about.

902
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:16,517
Just tell me what it is,
and I'll take care of it for you.

903
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:18,512
It's Harry. What about Harry?

904
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:21,399
Harry? Don't you think about Harry.

905
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:22,755
Now he's part of the Earth.

906
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:25,036
He's with eternity, the ages.

907
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:27,510
Take my word for it.
Harry's ancient history.

908
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:31,472
Come in, whoever it is.

909
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:36,233
What happened?

910
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:39,199
Sam, I've got something to tell you.

911
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:42,916
No, Captain. I have
something to tell him.

912
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:45,959
Now who's going to tell what?

913
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:51,475
I killed Harry Worp with the leather heel
of my hiking shoe.

914
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:56,715
- So it was you.
- We're on our way

915
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:59,793
to get Calvin Wiggs
and have him call the state police.

916
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:02,634
- I keep telling her there's no need.
- He's right.

917
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:05,554
And besides, it'd be indecent.
Harry's dead and buried.

918
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:08,030
Sam, I've got something to tell you.

919
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:12,073
- You haven't dug him up again.
- Well, I...

920
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:22,355
I insisted, Mr. Marlow.

921
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:26,440
- Don't you understand?
- You have nothing to fear.

922
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:30,351
It's my concern entirely.
As soon as Captain Wiles

923
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:33,837
told me the full circumstances
of his being here,

924
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:35,991
I knew there was
nothing for me to hide.

925
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:37,913
You know all about Harry?

926
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,152
Well, I'm afraid I do,
Mrs. Rogers, and after all

927
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:44,278
nobody could possibly gossip
about a lady and a maniac.

928
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:46,113
You'd be surprised.

929
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:47,336
I mean, you don't quite understand

930
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:49,113
what murder involves, Miss Gravely.

931
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:52,193
There'd be hours and hours
of questioning and photographs

932
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:53,616
and the whole of your private life

933
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:55,040
spread indecently in the newspapers.

934
01:05:57,040 --> 01:06:00,351
What makes you think
my private life is indecent?

935
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:03,393
I didn't mean that. I meant
that the way they pry is indecent.

936
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:04,960
They'll hound you to death.

937
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:08,192
There'll be newspapermen,
and photographers, and detectives...

938
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:11,478
- I've made up my mind.
- She certainly has.

939
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:14,678
It was Captain Wiles here
who persuaded me to call

940
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:17,798
and tell Mrs. Rogers
what I propose to do.

941
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:21,840
After all, she is most closely
connected with the business.

942
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:24,480
What do you think
about it, Mrs. Rogers?

943
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:27,553
I can't see why you're all making
such a fuss about Harry.

944
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:31,310
If he was buried, I don't see
why you had to dig him up.

945
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:34,677
But since you have, I guess
you'd better do what you think best.

946
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:36,678
Frankly, I don't care
what you do with Harry.

947
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:38,680
Just as long as you don't
bring him back to life.

948
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:43,516
- I have a free hand then.
- Free as a bird.

949
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:46,036
As far as I'm concerned,
it's ancient history.

950
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:48,078
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Jennifer.

951
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:50,550
I think we've forgotten something.

952
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:52,353
Do you realize if this thing comes out,

953
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:53,736
that all the details of your marriage

954
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:56,275
will be public property?

955
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:58,800
Oh...

956
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:02,591
I must confess,
I hadn't thought of that either.

957
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:06,396
- Where'd you put Harry this time?
- Over by the big oak tree.

958
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:09,239
I'll get my shovel.

959
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:11,437
I'm afraid I'm causing you
rather a lot of hard work.

960
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:13,631
- I'm sorry.
- Not at all, not at all.

961
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:16,713
Well, let's all go up there.

962
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:21,429
You know, I've never been to
a homemade funeral before.

963
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:24,271
I have.

964
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:27,194
This is my third.

965
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:29,511
All in one day.

966
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:39,714
Well, let's get it over with.

967
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:41,678
Yes.

968
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:55,471
I think we ought to cement it over.

969
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:59,110
Next spring, I'll set out
some blueberry bushes.

970
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:02,113
Couldn't you make it something else?
Lilacs, maybe?

971
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:06,029
- I think nature will take good care of it.
- How about a little service?

972
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:09,477
I can't think of anything to say.
Besides, my arms ache.

973
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:14,510
It's too late to say prayers. Besides,
wherever he was going, he's there now.

974
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:17,070
Bye, Harry. I forgive you.

975
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:29,118
- Trumpets welcoming Harry.
- You didn't know Harry.

976
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:31,271
I'd like to paint you
like that, Jennifer.

977
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:34,000
You look beautiful,
glistening in the moonlight.

978
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:37,631
Sounds as if it's coming down
from near the village.

979
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:39,359
I know what it is.

980
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,717
It's the call of the phantom stagecoach

981
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:44,839
that used to pass by here
each night 200 years ago.

982
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:47,316
- Phantom coach?
- The old turnpike

983
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:49,517
used to run right across
those foothills over there.

984
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:52,354
Oh, to be a highwayman
on a night like this.

985
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:54,796
Listen. Somebody's running.

986
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,016
Horses?

987
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:58,640
- If it's a horse, it's learned how to shout.
- What's she saying?

988
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:00,871
We'll know in a minute.
She's coming this way.

989
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:05,791
- Sam Marlow!
- It's Wiggy, old Wiggy.

990
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:10,791
Mr. Marlow, Mr. Marlow.

991
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:14,272
Wiggy, Wiggy, what on Earth
do you want?

992
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:17,040
- I... He wants...
- Wait a minute. Catch your breath.

993
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:18,640
- He's a millionaire.
- Who?

994
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:21,076
He wants to buy
your pictures, Mr. Marlow.

995
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:23,840
- Which pictures?
- All of 'em and more besides.

996
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:25,718
He says you're a genius.

997
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:29,032
He's right, but it's still hard to believe
he wants to buy all my pictures.

998
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:31,914
I'd be too curious to refuse
at least to talk to him.

999
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,231
Don't turn down
a good chance, Mr. Marlow.

1000
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:36,789
All right, all right. I'll talk to him.

1001
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:41,957
- Sassafras root.
- Sassafras tea's mighty good for you.

1002
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:44,953
Mr. Wiggs always swore it cured
his arthritis just before he died.

1003
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:46,992
How much does the millionaire
want to pay?

1004
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:50,477
Well, I asked seven dollars for that one
that looks like a lot of blobs of color

1005
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,016
- caught in a thunderstorm.
- And?

1006
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:53,296
Said he couldn't think of it.

1007
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:54,976
- Said they were priceless.
- Priceless?

1008
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,231
Sounds like something
I painted in kindergarten.

1009
01:09:57,320 --> 01:10:00,256
I'll have you know that picture's
symbolic of the beginning of the world.

1010
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:02,795
That's where I first heard
of the world, at kindergarten.

1011
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:08,314
Yes, and my friend here, art critic
for the Modern Museum, he says...

1012
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:11,831
Don't think I'm rude, but it doesn't matter
to me what an art critic says.

1013
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:15,277
- Oh, is that so?
- See, I know my paintings are good.

1014
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:17,113
He doesn't want them, you do.

1015
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:18,839
So all that matters is what you think.

1016
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:23,039
Well, I think they're works of genius,
and I want to buy them all.

1017
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:27,035
- Too bad.
- Why?

1018
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:29,317
Just decided I can't sell them.

1019
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:31,153
Besides, you couldn't afford them.

1020
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:35,833
Money.

1021
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,914
Sammy, don't be a fool.
Make him pay through the nose.

1022
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:42,549
Go ahead, Mr. Marlow. Be reasonable.

1023
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:46,833
- Be unreasonable if you want.
- What do you say?

1024
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:52,995
It's your genius, Sam. It's up to you.

1025
01:10:56,720 --> 01:11:00,157
All right, then. What do you like
most in the whole world?

1026
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:05,478
I don't know. Strawberries, I guess.

1027
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:09,957
Strawberries. Write that down.
Two boxes of fresh strawberries

1028
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:12,919
first of each month,
in season and out of season

1029
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,195
from now on.

1030
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:16,840
Well, it's simple. What else?

1031
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:19,039
What would Arnie like?

1032
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:22,313
A chemical set.

1033
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:25,871
- What kind?
- Whatever smells the worst.

1034
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:28,272
- Got that?
- Right.

1035
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:31,432
One smelly chemical set.

1036
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,239
Wiggy, what would you like?

1037
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:35,960
Cash register. Chromium plated.
One that rings a bell.

1038
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:38,600
- Got room for one?
- I'll find room.

1039
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:41,440
- Cash register.
- Chromium plated. One that rings a bell?

1040
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:43,196
Check.

1041
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:46,432
Miss Gravely, a beauty
parlor fully equipped?

1042
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:48,751
What for?

1043
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:53,551
A hope chest filled with the things
I should have put in it and didn't.

1044
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:57,193
A hope chest, full of hope.

1045
01:11:57,640 --> 01:12:02,920
- Captain?
- A good shotgun, plenty of ammunition,

1046
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:09,077
some corduroy britches, a plain shirt
and a hunting cap, a brown one.

1047
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:11,950
Davy Crockett... The works.

1048
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:16,074
Well, that's it, I guess.
The paintings are yours.

1049
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:20,314
- Yes, but what about you?
- Yes, Sam, you've gotta ask for something.

1050
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:22,797
Well, let's see.

1051
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:26,956
That's it.

1052
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:31,195
- What's it?
- Pardon me.

1053
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:38,112
What do you think?

1054
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:43,877
Yes, I think that can
be easily arranged.

1055
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:51,959
Well, that's it, then. I'll come back
in the morning for all these paintings.

1056
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:57,240
Mr. Marlow, this has been a night that
I shall remember the rest of my life.

1057
01:12:57,320 --> 01:13:00,358
Come back again. Have some more
paintings for you next month.

1058
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:06,511
And you'll have a steady customer in me,
even if you raise your prices.

1059
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:09,877
- Well, good night, everyone.
- Good night.

1060
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:12,191
All right, young man.

1061
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:19,835
Congratulations, Sammy. Good boy.

1062
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:21,513
Did I do the right thing?

1063
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,637
You did just the right thing, Sam.

1064
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:25,279
Good.

1065
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:29,595
Because it's important
to me that you think so.

1066
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:31,399
Why?

1067
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:34,359
Because I love you.
I want to marry you.

1068
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:44,713
- You want to marry me?
- Why not?

1069
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:50,079
Because I just got my freedom today.

1070
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:52,720
Easy come, easy go.

1071
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:55,759
Besides, if you married me,
you'd keep your freedom.

1072
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:00,315
You must be practically unique, then.

1073
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:04,440
I respect freedom.
More than that, I love freedom.

1074
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:07,672
We might be the only
free married couple in the world.

1075
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:14,195
This is very sudden, Sam.

1076
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:20,954
You'll have to give me
a little time to think about it.

1077
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:25,319
Only fair. I'll give you till
we get back to your house.

1078
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:33,478
What's goin' on here
this time o' night?

1079
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:35,016
The most wonderful thing happened.

1080
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:37,635
Mr. Marlow sold all his
paintings to a millionaire.

1081
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:40,235
- Got more'n I ever figured he'd get.
- Money?

1082
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:43,799
Well, not exactly money.

1083
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:46,873
I always knew they
weren't worth the space.

1084
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,038
I found these on
a tramp hangin' 'round here.

1085
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:53,557
Said he found 'em on a dead man.

1086
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:57,556
Took me to where
he said he found him, and

1087
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:01,800
I didn't see anybody.

1088
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:06,990
Montpelier-2000.

1089
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:10,272
- That's the state police number.
- Uh-huh.

1090
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:13,074
I think we'd better get going.

1091
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:15,671
Thank you, Mr. Marlow,
for the cash register.

1092
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:17,956
It was a pleasure. Good night.

1093
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:20,236
Good night. Good night.

1094
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:23,755
Good night, Captain.

1095
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:30,320
This is Deputy Sheriff Calvin Wiggs.

1096
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,312
Yeah, I'll wait.

1097
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:50,709
Ma?

1098
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:57,156
- This picture here on the floor.
- It's a new one.

1099
01:15:57,280 --> 01:16:00,432
He did it today, but it isn't for sale.

1100
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:03,558
- Why not?
- You'll have to ask him that.

1101
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:06,439
He left it on his way
over to Jennifer Rogers' house.

1102
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:10,313
Guess he didn't
have time to take it home.

1103
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:14,872
You suddenly got interested in art?

1104
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:17,040
No.

1105
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:22,233
It's just that it matches
the description of...

1106
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:24,880
Oh, hello, Sergeant.

1107
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:26,872
Calvin Wiggs.

1108
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:29,714
Got something that might
interest you a little.

1109
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:33,760
It seems I picked up this tramp
with a pair of stolen shoes

1110
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:36,912
and a wild story about a corpse.

1111
01:16:57,120 --> 01:17:00,352
What do you think, him walking
in with Harry Worp's shoes

1112
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:03,433
in his hand and then
that phone call to the police?

1113
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:05,432
I don't know.

1114
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:08,080
I may be wrong, but I don't think
he's tied us into it yet.

1115
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:10,436
Oh, the way he looked at me.

1116
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:12,990
If he'd known anything,
he'd have kept us there.

1117
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:16,278
But modern police methods are
all psychological now, Sammy.

1118
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:17,675
Psychological.

1119
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:22,596
They just wear you down
and wear you down until

1120
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:25,559
you're almost grateful
to get into that gas chamber.

1121
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:30,351
The police will probably tell him
if the shoes fit, to keep them.

1122
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:47,757
- I've decided, Sam.
- Decided what?

1123
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:49,559
I will marry you

1124
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:52,758
if you haven't forgotten
about asking me.

1125
01:17:54,240 --> 01:18:00,237
I'm very fond of you and I think
you'd make a good father for Arnie

1126
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:06,158
and for some other reasons
best left unsaid.

1127
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:09,311
Marriage is the comfortable way
to spend the winter,

1128
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:12,520
but right now we should be
working on some good story

1129
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:15,320
to satisfy the state police
if they should turn up.

1130
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:20,519
Would you believe it?
I'd almost forgotten that proposal.

1131
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:24,237
- I have witnesses, Sam.
- I remember now.

1132
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:28,280
All right. You've got
yourself a husband.

1133
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:30,955
I think I'll kiss you now to prove it.

1134
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:42,160
Lightly, Sam. I have a very short fuse.

1135
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:54,636
What a pretty sight.

1136
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:05,155
Sam, what did you ask
the millionaire for?

1137
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:14,350
That's very practical.

1138
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:20,510
- Congratulations, my dear.
- Thank you.

1139
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:23,911
You're a lucky man, Sammy.
I think you'll both be very happy.

1140
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,912
- Thank you.
- If I grumbled too much

1141
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,755
at my share of the work
in burying Harry, I'm sorry.

1142
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:31,911
I can see now it was well worth it.

1143
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,835
- If I can do anything else...
- Hold it. Hold it. Hold it.

1144
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:41,398
What's wrong, Sam?

1145
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:44,040
Harry. We're not quite
finished with him yet.

1146
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:46,437
Well, Sam, if anybody's
through, it's Harry.

1147
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:47,954
He's been buried three times.

1148
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:50,696
Before we can get married, you're gonna
have to prove that you're free.

1149
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:52,616
To prove you're free,
you'll have to prove that Harry...

1150
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:53,869
Is dead.

1151
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:57,792
What a horrible complication.

1152
01:19:57,920 --> 01:19:58,920
Oh!

1153
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:04,471
I don't know that it is.

1154
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:06,870
What are you looking at me for?

1155
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:12,600
Sammy, Sammy, I'll do anything
to help you, but please,

1156
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:15,155
please don't ask me
to dig up Harry again!

1157
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:18,711
- Oh, come, come now, Captain.
- No, we can't.

1158
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:20,672
If you're thinking of
the bad publicity...

1159
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:25,994
No, I'm not. I think Sam would be
worth just about anything.

1160
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:29,475
I'm thinking of you, Miss Gravely.

1161
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:34,396
Murder is murder, no matter
how exonerating the circumstances and...

1162
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:36,836
It just wouldn't
look nice at all for you.

1163
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:39,992
That's right! Better let
him stay where he is.

1164
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:43,915
You only have to wait seven years
to presume death, anyway.

1165
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,912
Seven years! I'll be an old man.

1166
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:48,993
Don't be silly. You waited far longer
than seven years already.

1167
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:52,198
Yes, but now I know
what I'm waiting for.

1168
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:54,590
I insist that you dig
the wretched man up.

1169
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:57,112
I don't care a hoot what they say.

1170
01:20:57,240 --> 01:21:00,472
They'd only have to know me to realize
the man must have been mad.

1171
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:03,200
I disagree.

1172
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:04,919
Really, Captain Wiles?

1173
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:08,913
Well...

1174
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,037
I'll dig him up.

1175
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:13,237
But we'd better get it done
before Calvin Wiggs

1176
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:16,233
gets the state police
snooping around here.

1177
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,834
I've been thinking.

1178
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:28,799
I've been thinking maybe we could
forget the way it really happened.

1179
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:33,039
I could tell how Harry visited me
and went off in such a rage today

1180
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:36,158
and that's all we'd need to know
about his being there.

1181
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:38,675
No, somebody else might get the blame

1182
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:42,993
and somebody else might not have
such a good reason as I did.

1183
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:44,594
What do you mean "somebody else"?

1184
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:48,231
I can think of at least
two people around here

1185
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,391
with a good reason for
having killed Harry.

1186
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,710
First you, because you married him.
And now Sam.

1187
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:58,790
Me? Why would I want to kill him?
I never met him before.

1188
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,872
You could still have
a reason for killing him.

1189
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:03,591
- She means me.
- Yes.

1190
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:06,560
I didn't fall in love with Jennifer
until after Harry was dead.

1191
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:08,677
Try telling that to the police.

1192
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,310
She's right, Sammy boy.

1193
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:15,471
On second thought,
we'd better stick to the truth.

1194
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:16,755
What there is of it.

1195
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:27,119
We'll have to think up a reason
why the police weren't informed before now.

1196
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:29,510
Yes, then there's
the condition he's in.

1197
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:30,720
That'll take some explaining.

1198
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:33,357
We'll just clean him up a bit.

1199
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:36,274
It's horrible, but there's
nothing else we can do.

1200
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:38,920
We can't risk complicating
Miss Gravely's confession.

1201
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,913
And as for the delay,
I can explain that I was so upset

1202
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,391
by the occurrence that
I went straight home and rested.

1203
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:49,600
- Only natural.
- They'll think you rested rather a long time.

1204
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:52,434
Sam, I'd rather not spend
the whole night debating.

1205
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:55,080
Let's get Harry someplace
and clean him up.

1206
01:22:58,040 --> 01:23:00,396
Let's get out of here.

1207
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:13,551
"Love alters not with his brief
hours and weeks,

1208
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:16,952
"but bears it out even
to the edge of doom.

1209
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:20,670
"If this be error and upon me proved,

1210
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:24,879
"I never writ, nor man ever loved."

1211
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:38,599
I think he met with a bit of
an accident, Dr. Greenbow.

1212
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:40,832
He certainly did.

1213
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:45,832
- Which of you found him?
- Well...

1214
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:47,991
He was my husband, Doctor.

1215
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:51,158
Oh, Ms. Rogers, I didn't know
you had a husband.

1216
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:52,594
I'm awfully sorry.

1217
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:56,878
It's all right, Doctor.
It's just life, I guess.

1218
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:59,759
- What happened to him?
- Well, he...

1219
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:01,416
Well, that's what we'd
like to know, Doctor.

1220
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:04,558
Could you tell us what caused
his death? It was so sudden.

1221
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:07,200
In this light, my opinion would be
little more than a guess.

1222
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:10,079
In that case, we could take him
someplace where you could see better.

1223
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:13,870
All right, but I need my bag.
Where shall we meet?

1224
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:16,270
I'll take Harry home to my house.

1225
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:22,155
Going home for the last time.

1226
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:30,315
Better be the last time.

1227
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:33,279
Come on, Sam. I've got about
one more trip left in me.

1228
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:35,477
I'll get your coats.

1229
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:32,716
I'll get the suspenders on.

1230
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:42,951
I can't wait for this to be ready.
I'll have to iron it dry.

1231
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,753
Isn't it odd?

1232
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:51,471
After refusing for so long,
here I am finally doing Harry's laundry.

1233
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:14,636
Look.

1234
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:17,189
It's nothing to get
excited about, Captain.

1235
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:20,239
It's only a closet door.

1236
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:23,000
I thought it was Harry.

1237
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:25,800
Relax, Captain. Nothing to worry about.

1238
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:34,957
What about the cut I made on his head
with my hiking shoe?

1239
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:38,159
I'll put some adhesive tape on it.

1240
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:40,197
They'll think
it was done before he died.

1241
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:43,114
After the shirt's finished,
it should be just about everything.

1242
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:47,999
- If that's who I think it is...
- Calvin Wiggs' car.

1243
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:14,237
Just one minute.

1244
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:26,234
Well, Calvin Wiggs. What a surprise.

1245
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:29,074
- Sam here?
- Yes, yes, yes, he's here.

1246
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:31,311
Can I see him a minute?

1247
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:34,198
- Sam.
- Yeah?

1248
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:36,590
Calvin Wiggs is here to see you.

1249
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:38,592
Tell him I'll be right out.

1250
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:42,151
- He says he'll be right out.
- Why don't I just go on in?

1251
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:53,240
- Evening, Calvin.
- Evening, Captain Wiles. Miss Gravely.

1252
01:27:53,320 --> 01:27:55,516
We've got him on the run
in four spades.

1253
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:58,593
They should have been in diamonds.

1254
01:27:58,680 --> 01:28:01,639
- Play much bridge?
- Never play it.

1255
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:03,279
That's what I thought.

1256
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:04,680
Something you wanted, Calvin?

1257
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:08,911
- Where were you today, Sam?
- Working, as usual.

1258
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:13,275
Somewheres down by Mansfield Meadows?

1259
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:15,716
Possibly. I do quite a bit
of sketching around. Why?

1260
01:28:19,240 --> 01:28:21,232
Is that where, uh...

1261
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:26,035
Where you painted this?

1262
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:30,676
I left that portrait with your mother.

1263
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:33,600
What right do you have to carry it
around with you? It might be damaged.

1264
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:37,479
It could be priceless,
and Sam would lose a sale.

1265
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:40,394
I'll send him a box of blueberries
the first of every month.

1266
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:44,152
Sam, what I wanna know is
where'd you paint it and who is it?

1267
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:47,559
First of all, it's not a painting.
It's a drawing.

1268
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:51,236
Matter of fact, it's a pastel,
and as for the model,

1269
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:53,993
just came to me out of the blue.

1270
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:55,833
You don't say.

1271
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:58,116
Why you acting like a deputy sheriff?

1272
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:00,999
That tramp I picked up, the one
with the stolen shoes?

1273
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:03,675
Said he got 'em off a dead man?

1274
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:05,479
Well, he described him very carefully.

1275
01:29:05,560 --> 01:29:07,870
The description fits
this picture to a T.

1276
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:11,920
A tramp who probably can't keep
his job and drinks too much...

1277
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,469
I wouldn't think his word
was very reliable.

1278
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:17,676
Got him locked up in the schoolhouse.

1279
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:20,376
- I took this painting down to show him...
- Drawing, if you don't mind.

1280
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:23,279
I took the drawing down to show him.
He almost fainted.

1281
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:26,478
Said it was the same face.
Where'd you paint it, Sam?

1282
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:31,594
From my vast subconscious.

1283
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:35,350
Sam, I hate to say this,
but I don't believe you.

1284
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:37,440
With all this talk,
I've lost interest in the game.

1285
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:39,796
If you'll forgive me,
I'll just run along home.

1286
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:42,076
I'll see you all tomorrow.

1287
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:47,797
What do you mean, you don't believe me?

1288
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:53,230
What I mean, Sam...
I ain't educated in fancy art,

1289
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:56,996
but I do know the face of a dead man
when I see one, and this is it.

1290
01:29:57,120 --> 01:30:00,955
Well, Calvin, perhaps I can
educate you to "fancy art."

1291
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:05,550
See this? Portrait of a sleeping face.

1292
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:10,556
A man, relaxed, far removed
from earthly cares.

1293
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:14,759
It was conceived out of memory
and half-forgotten impulse

1294
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,469
and it emerged from the shadows
of abstract emotions

1295
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:22,715
until it was born full-grown from
the mechanical realities of my fingertips.

1296
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:25,560
- Oh, now, Sam, don't...
- I don't have to have a model to draw from.

1297
01:30:25,640 --> 01:30:28,280
Instead of creating a sleeping face,
I could have

1298
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:31,632
chosen an entirely different
set of artistic stimuli.

1299
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:35,919
My subconscious is peopled
with enough faces to cover the Earth.

1300
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,880
And the construction of the human anatomy
alone is so infinitely variable

1301
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:42,919
as to lie beyond the wildest powers
of calculation.

1302
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:47,759
Now, a raised eyelid, perhaps.

1303
01:30:50,640 --> 01:30:54,111
A line of fullness to the cheek.

1304
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:56,920
Lip that bends with expression.

1305
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:00,713
There.

1306
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:06,193
- Sam, do you know what you just did?
- Certainly.

1307
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:09,678
Just showed you how clearly
you misinterpreted my art.

1308
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:11,717
You just destroyed legal evidence.

1309
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:17,840
Calvin, it appears to me
you still don't understand.

1310
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:20,913
I understand you made
kind of a fool out of me.

1311
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,200
But I still got enough evidence

1312
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:24,317
to know something funny's
goin' on around here.

1313
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:27,313
I ain't goin' to sleep
till I find out what it is.

1314
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:32,720
Good night, Calvin.

1315
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:38,395
Hey, what's he doin' in our bathtub?

1316
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:44,313
That's where frogs belong.

1317
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:45,400
Oh!

1318
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:47,512
Back to bed, Arnie. Back to bed.

1319
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:49,216
State troopers
will be up in the mornin'.

1320
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:52,597
I'm gonna want 'em to have
a talk with you, so be around.

1321
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:55,634
- I said back to bed.
- You can find me at my studio.

1322
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:58,234
Just make sure...

1323
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:05,072
Where is he?

1324
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:09,755
He's in the bathroom
playing with his frog.

1325
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:12,996
Oh!

1326
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:14,240
Um...

1327
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:17,319
This way, please, Doctor.

1328
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:19,591
It's Arnie. He's not very well.

1329
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:25,796
Someone must be foolin'
around with my car.

1330
01:32:36,720 --> 01:32:40,350
What are you playin' with the horn for?
It ain't your car.

1331
01:32:40,440 --> 01:32:43,274
Well, things are funny, you know?

1332
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:45,272
Me and Miss Gravely
might be in the car market.

1333
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:46,616
We're looking for a car.

1334
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:49,951
Yes. Had a look at this one.
It's a beauty.

1335
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:51,992
I want to keep it that way.

1336
01:32:52,160 --> 01:32:55,392
Now, now, that's not the way
to talk to a prospective customer.

1337
01:32:55,480 --> 01:32:58,791
You're no prospective customer.
You can't afford this car.

1338
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:13,078
He's gone.

1339
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:16,676
I put the little...
I put Arnie back to bed.

1340
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:19,753
- What'd the doctor say?
- He said for me to get out.

1341
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:23,960
I didn't like the look in his eye, either.
Something seems to be bothering him.

1342
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:30,235
Well, Captain. Did you get over
being frightened?

1343
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:33,113
Frightened?

1344
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:34,520
Oh!

1345
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:36,679
That's not why I left.

1346
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:40,231
No. I'm not easily frightened,
you know.

1347
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:44,200
Why, after all those years sailing
the four corners of the globe,

1348
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:47,791
strange ports,
a lot of rough men and...

1349
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:54,520
Miss Gravely, what would you say

1350
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:56,717
if I told you

1351
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:59,998
I was only the captain of a tugboat

1352
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:01,833
on the East River

1353
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:05,470
and never got more
than a mile or so offshore?

1354
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:14,675
Well, I would say that...

1355
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:17,514
That you were the handsomest
tugboat captain

1356
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:19,910
that ever sailed up the East River.

1357
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:24,719
Oh, maybe not. No.

1358
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:27,315
You want to see something? Here.

1359
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:34,191
- Where'd you get those?
- Calvin Wiggs' car.

1360
01:34:35,240 --> 01:34:37,391
I figured you were handling
half the evidence, Sammy,

1361
01:34:37,480 --> 01:34:39,392
so it was up to me
to take care of the rest.

1362
01:34:39,480 --> 01:34:42,598
You're the sweetest
little tugboat captain I ever kissed.

1363
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:45,598
What's he doing in the bathtub?

1364
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:48,593
Well... What'd you find out, Doctor?

1365
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:52,913
Oh, that. It was his heart.
He had a seizure.

1366
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:55,999
- His heart?
- Yes, but...

1367
01:34:56,120 --> 01:34:58,999
- A seizure!
- Well, I'll take a trip to the Philippines!

1368
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:02,079
- Death from natural causes.
- Well, certainly.

1369
01:35:02,680 --> 01:35:04,280
But will somebody
tell me what he's doin'

1370
01:35:04,360 --> 01:35:06,829
in the bathtub half undressed?

1371
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:11,198
Frankly, we didn't want
Calvin Wiggs to see him.

1372
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:15,709
Besides, he was awful dirty
after we dug him up.

1373
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:18,190
"Dug him up"?

1374
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:21,034
I'd better explain, Doctor. You see,

1375
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:24,033
Harry's been buried and dug up
on and off all day long.

1376
01:35:24,120 --> 01:35:25,600
What?

1377
01:35:25,680 --> 01:35:28,479
Finally, he caused
so many complications that

1378
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:31,871
we decided to clean him up and
put him back where we found him.

1379
01:35:31,960 --> 01:35:34,429
I don't understand you.
What complications?

1380
01:35:35,320 --> 01:35:37,357
Well, for example,

1381
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:40,512
he upset Captain Wiles because
the Captain thought he had shot him.

1382
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:44,276
The hole in the head. But as it
turned out, it wasn't the Captain.

1383
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:46,536
It was the blow he got from
the heel of Miss Gravely's shoe

1384
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:48,279
after he attacked her.

1385
01:35:48,360 --> 01:35:50,397
Captain Wiles attacked Miss Gravely?

1386
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:53,837
Oh, no, Doctor. Harry.

1387
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:56,037
He dragged her into the bushes
thinking it was me.

1388
01:35:56,720 --> 01:36:00,430
He was dazed, I suppose, after I hit him
on the head with the milk bottle.

1389
01:36:04,440 --> 01:36:07,274
The Captain and Sam buried him first.

1390
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:09,875
The Captain was so scared.

1391
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:14,318
But then he accounted for all his bullets,
so up Harry came.

1392
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:17,240
Then Miss Gravely thought
her shoe was responsible for it, so...

1393
01:36:17,320 --> 01:36:19,198
- Shoe?
- So the Captain,

1394
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:23,240
rather gallantly, I thought,
pushed him back in again.

1395
01:36:23,320 --> 01:36:26,631
Then he was out and back
and I can't remember why.

1396
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:29,792
But anyway, he's out again now
because Sam and I wanna get married.

1397
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:34,159
- Yeah. But why did you...
- Hit him on the head?

1398
01:36:34,720 --> 01:36:36,234
That wouldn't interest you, Doctor.

1399
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:38,471
It's purely personal and non-medical.

1400
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:42,190
Besides, it's awfully late, so if you'll
just keep quiet about all this,

1401
01:36:42,280 --> 01:36:44,476
we'll put Harry back
in the morning, nice and clean,

1402
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:46,472
and no one will be any the wiser.

1403
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:49,029
Then we'll be rid of all these
sticky complications.

1404
01:36:49,120 --> 01:36:51,430
Put him back. Put him back,
that's all. Just put him back.

1405
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:54,752
This is the first nightmare
I've had in 25 years.

1406
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:00,713
He's kind of strange, isn't he?

1407
01:37:08,120 --> 01:37:11,158
Well, hadn't we better
get Harry dressed?

1408
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:13,152
Yes, yes.

1409
01:37:19,720 --> 01:37:22,838
Wouldn't it be nice if Arnie found him
all over again?

1410
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:25,833
Then he'd run home and tell me,
and then I'd phone Calvin Wiggs.

1411
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:28,754
Yes! Arnie could explain
quite clearly to Calvin...

1412
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:33,033
- That he found Harry tomorrow.
- You mean today.

1413
01:37:33,120 --> 01:37:35,794
But to Arnie, tomorrow is yesterday.

1414
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:39,909
Let's go get Harry. Come on, Captain.

1415
01:37:54,240 --> 01:37:55,799
Here he comes.

1416
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:17,637
Go on, Arnie. Run home
and tell me about it.

1417
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:19,513
Don't touch him.

1418
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:22,075
Please, Arnie, run home
and tell your mother.

1419
01:38:22,160 --> 01:38:24,152
Beat it, you little creep.

1420
01:38:24,240 --> 01:38:26,800
I mean, hurry home, son.

1421
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:39,470
Captain, you never told me
your first name.

1422
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:41,432
Albert. What's yours?

1423
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:45,918
Ivy. Albert, let's go.

1424
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,960
Just a minute, ma'am.
I want to ask Sam something.

1425
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,993
Sam, what did you ask
the millionaire to bring you?

1426
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:01,319
Albert, what was it?

1427
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:04,193
A double bed.
