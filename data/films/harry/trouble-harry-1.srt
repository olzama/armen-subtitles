1
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,430
<i>Okay, I know how to handle your type!</i>

2
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,760
Well, old faithful,
that's your shooting for the day.

3
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,675
If we haven't rung up
at least two rabbits,

4
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,360
we deserve to go home empty-handed.

5
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,753
Yeah. Still, blessed are they
who expect nothing

6
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,877
for they shall not be disappointed.

7
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,040
Hmm.

8
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,953
Fewer things in life give
a man more pleasure than hunting.

9
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,475
It satisfies his primitive nature.

10
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,280
Striding through the woods,
picking up his kill.

11
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,400
Well, come on, old faithful.

12
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,871
There's plump rabbits
waiting for the frying pan.

13
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,469
If this can had four legs and a tail,
we'd be eating it tonight.

14
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,552
Clean through the heart.

15
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,592
For rice cake, I've done him in.

16
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,877
A harmless potshot at a rabbit
and I'm a murderer, a killer.

17
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,873
Mother always said
I'd come to a bad end.

18
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,634
What in Hades were
you doing here anyway?

19
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,834
I can't say that I've
seen you around here before.

20
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,113
If you're going to get yourself shot,
do it where you're known.

21
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,276
"Mr. Harry Worp, 87 Maple Avenue,
Boston, Massachusetts."

22
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,550
Well, Worp, you're
a long way from home.

23
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,678
By the looks of it, you won't
get back for Christmas.

24
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,394
We're going to have
a cold, hard winter.

25
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,791
You might keep here a long time,
an awful long time.

26
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,872
Too long for me, Harry.

27
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,280
Yes.

28
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,640
Captain Wiles.

29
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,314
Yes, ma'am?

30
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,992
What seems to be the trouble, Captain?

31
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,040
Well, it's what you might call
an unavoidable accident.

32
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,992
He's dead.

33
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,400
Yes.

34
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,800
I would say that he was. Of course,
that's an unprofessional opinion.

35
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:18,358
- Do you know him, Miss Gravely?
- No.

36
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,955
- Doesn't live around here.
- Well, he died around here.

37
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,315
That's what counts now.

38
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:26,593
Embarrassing. What do you plan
to do with him, Captain?

39
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,080
Miss Gravely,

40
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,280
without cutting the hem
off truth's garment,

41
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,149
I'm going to hide him.
Cover him up. Forget him.

42
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,598
Are you never going to
inform the police, Captain?

43
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,117
No. Forget you saw me, Miss Gravely.

44
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,398
Chase it out of your mind,
for heaven's sake. It was an accident.

45
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,679
He was poking around the clearing
and I thought he was a rabbit or something.

46
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,433
It was a human error.

47
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,637
Please, don't.

48
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,229
Don't say anything
to anybody, Miss Gravely.

49
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,229
Do as you think best, Captain.

50
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,472
I'm sure you must have met
many similar situations

51
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,517
in your travels in foreign lands.

52
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,831
Yeah, I've seen much worse things.

53
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,156
- I certainly won't say anything.
- Much worse things.

54
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,038
I remember when I was on the <i>Orinoco.</i>

55
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,830
We had a Turk, a great big Turk
there running amok with a machete.

56
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,913
Captain, if I were going to hide
an accident, I shouldn't delay.

57
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,717
You're right as rain, Miss Gravely.

58
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,760
Yes, you know something?
I'm glad I met you today.

59
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:41,076
I feel better for telling somebody as warm,
tender, understanding as yourself.

60
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:48,600
On the contrary, Captain, it...

61
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,918
I'm certainly glad
if I helped you, Captain.

62
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,277
Perhaps you would care to come over
for some blueberry muffins

63
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,794
and coffee later on.

64
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,758
High-bush blueberries.

65
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,150
This is certainly something
of an interesting surprise.

66
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,960
And perhaps a touch of elderberry wine.

67
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,196
After all, we've been neighbors
for nearly three years now

68
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,237
and we've never exchanged social calls.

69
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,159
You're right.
It's high time I paid a call.

70
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,475
What time?

71
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,280
Oh, say, early this afternoon?

72
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,149
I'll be there with a clean shirt
and a hungry face.

73
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,595
Do that.

74
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,634
You'd better be going along now.

75
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,640
You don't want to be
an accessory after the fact.

76
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,595
You are a considerate man,
Captain Wiles.

77
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,992
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

78
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,754
We're almost there, Mommy.

79
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,199
Here he is, Mommy, here he is.

80
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,639
- What did I tell you, Mommy?
- Don't touch it, Arnie.

81
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,200
There he is.

82
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,674
No, it can't be. Harry.

83
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,440
Harry. Thank Providence,
the last of Harry.

84
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,874
Who's Providence, Mommy?

85
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,271
- A very good friend.
- Don't you know who it is?

86
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,875
You said, "Harry."
Can't you remember, Arnie?

87
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,191
Why don't he get up and do something?

88
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,397
He's asleep.

89
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,116
He's in a deep sleep.
A deep, wonderful sleep.

90
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,237
How'd he hurt his head?

91
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,636
Putting it where it wasn't
wanted would be my guess.

92
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,796
Will it get better?

93
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,040
Not if we're lucky.

94
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,256
Let's run home and I'll make you
some lemonade.

95
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,591
Will lemonade put me in a wonderful,
deep, deep sleep, Mommy?

96
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,637
No, Arnie, but it's
better than no lemonade.

97
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,871
- I don't understand that.
- Never mind.

98
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,633
Now you just forget
you ever saw this man.

99
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,638
Is there a special way to forget?

100
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,776
Just think of something else.

101
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,031
I think I'll try not
to see him tomorrow, Mommy.

102
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,272
That's a good boy, Arnie. Now let's run
home and get that lemonade.

103
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,271
She won't care what I do with him.

104
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,555
Couldn't have had more people here
if I'd sold tickets.

105
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,596
What's the big attraction, I wonder.

106
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,633
This could turn out to be
the luckiest day of my life.

107
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,560
Might as well sit here till
the rest of the world comes by

108
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,040
to pay their last respects.

109
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,113
Sooner or later one of them has
to turn out to be the deputy sheriff.

110
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,235
<i>Flaggin' the train that's goin' home</i>

111
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,035
<i>Flaggin' the train to Tuscaloosa</i>

112
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,512
<i>Never no more, no more to roam</i>

113
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,910
<i>Gotta get back to Tuscaloosa</i>

114
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,640
<i>Got a sweet gal who's on my mind</i>

115
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,229
<i>Gotta get back to Tuscaloosa</i>

116
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,712
<i>Back to the gal I left behind</i>

117
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,200
<i>Got no baggage</i>

118
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,397
<i>Just got my fare</i>

119
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,120
<i>But all I need, yes, indeed</i>

120
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,999
<i>Is waitin' for me there</i>

121
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,549
<i>Flaggin' the train to Tuscaloosa</i>

122
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,996
<i>Oh, how I love that choo-choo sound</i>

123
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,390
<i>Flaggin' the train to Tuscaloosa</i>

124
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,952
<i>Flaggin' the train
that's homeward bound</i>

125
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,875
<i>Gotta get back to Tuscaloosa</i>

126
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,395
<i>Got a sweet gal who's on my mind</i>

127
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,830
<i>Gotta get back to Tuscaloosa</i>

128
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,755
<i>Back to the gal I left behind</i>

129
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,520
<i>Got no baggage</i>

130
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,671
<i>Just got my fare</i>

131
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,592
<i>But all I need, yes, indeed</i>

132
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,037
<i>Is waitin' for me there</i>

133
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,317
Hello, Mr. Marlow.

134
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,080
Wiggy, you haven't sold a painting.

135
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,356
All my pictures in the same place.

136
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,194
So few cars. They don't seem to...

137
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,755
- Guess the cider takes their attention.
- Cider?

138
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,911
Cider, indeed. Throw it away! Drink it!

139
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,673
No, I hate cider.

140
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,194
Not a picture sold.

141
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,671
I'm sorry, Mr. Marlow. Let's get a look
at your new one. Hold it up.

142
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,696
What good would it do to show it to you?
You don't deserve to see it.

143
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,836
How am I going to eat?

144
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,194
Mr. Wiggs always used to thump
his stomach when he got mad.

145
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,476
He busted something inside once.

146
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,277
You think we'd do any
better on Fifth Avenue?

147
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,352
If there's more people there.

148
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,672
Oh, lots of people. Hundreds and thousands
and billions of people.

149
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,439
Well, might be better then.

150
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,751
But what sort of people, Wiggy?
What breed?

151
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,674
I'll tell you. They're little people.

152
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,634
Little people with hats on.

153
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,359
How are your cigarettes?

154
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,071
I'll buy the other half tomorrow.

155
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,474
What does your son do with those
old cars he always works on?

156
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,313
He sells them. Mechanical antiques.

157
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,278
Doesn't make much,
but he needs the money.

158
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,392
Doesn't he get paid
for being deputy sheriff?

159
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,075
Piecework. Gets paid
by the arrest, I think.

160
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,997
Oh. Mr. Marlow, it's wonderful.

161
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,918
I've been in a tortured mood lately.

162
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,400
What is it?

163
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,359
Good old Wiggy, my sternest critic.

164
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,716
I don't understand your work.
I think it's beautiful.

165
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,519
So does Mrs. Rogers.

166
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,069
Oh! You talk about me?

167
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,976
She's the pretty woman
with the little boy, isn't she?

168
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Mmm-hmm.

169
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:09,074
I only brought up your name once
when we were talking about strange people.

170
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,389
Huh?

171
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,951
That is, strangers.
People she hadn't met yet.

172
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,715
And what does the pretty little thing
say about me?

173
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,315
Nothin'.

174
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:23,514
I think we better discuss business.
Now, my shopping list.

175
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,831
I'll go in and start puttin' it up.

176
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,554
Say, Wiggy, how do
you spell Tuscaloosa?

177
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,790
Sam?

178
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,995
Hi, Calvin.

179
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,117
- You hear any shootin' a while back?
- Nope.

180
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,238
Well, I did, and there shouldn't be
any shootin' around here.

181
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,080
- Why?
- It's posted land, that's why.

182
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,597
- Why's that?
- 'Cause I posted it.

183
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,976
What do you got against people doing
a little shooting now and then?

184
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,036
Let off a little steam.

185
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,920
Bullets and guns are dangerous.
They kill things.

186
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,994
No one around here could hit
a freight car with a cannon.

187
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,600
I guess you're right, Sam.

188
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,512
All the same the law's the law.

189
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,031
And I got a good mind to scout around,
find out who's doin' the shootin'

190
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,600
and level a little fine.

191
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,956
And pick up a little piecework?

192
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,999
If I can do anything to make it
any harder for you, let me know.

193
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,879
How do you want your bacon, Mr. Marlow?

194
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,956
- What were you saying?
- I asked how you want your bacon.

195
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,309
Sliced.

196
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,076
Where's Calvin?

197
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,311
Off somewheres unimportant.

198
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,313
What a wonderful day.

199
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,960
So was yesterday, but you didn't
say anything to me about it.

200
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,754
What you want Calvin for?

201
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,873
These marvelous pictures.

202
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,475
Someone told me they were yours.

203
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,517
Why don't you sell them,
make a lot of money?

204
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,896
Never thought of that.
Guess I'll just have to think about it.

205
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,310
And that song.
You sing it so beautifully.

206
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,232
You wrote it yourself, of course.

207
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,516
- What do you want to borrow?
- Oh, dear.

208
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,798
I just think people need encouragement
sometimes, don't you, Mr. Marlow?

209
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,112
- How do you know my name?
- Well, it's on the pictures, isn't it?

210
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,680
Not supposed to be readable.

211
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,274
You can tell it's not supposed to be.

212
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,757
They're very professional.
Don't you think, Mrs. Wiggs?

213
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,833
Well, Miss Gravely,
all I know is nobody buys them.

214
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,871
Thank you for your encouragement,
Miss Gravely.

215
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,952
I wonder how you know my name.

216
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,271
- Easy. Wiggy just said it.
- Wiggy.

217
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,955
What a perfectly
ridiculous little nickname.

218
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,475
Do you mind if I call
you "Wiggy," Mrs. Wiggs?

219
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,155
Not if you pay all your bills on time.

220
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,033
All right, Mr. Marlow.

221
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,954
Bacon, beans, cabbage, sugar, salt,

222
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:29,034
tea, oleo margarine. $1.95.

223
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,873
Don't forget half
a package of cigarettes.

224
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,959
- Oh, yes. Ten cents. $2.05.
- That much?

225
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,195
Don't seem to be able to find...

226
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,512
I know, Mr. Marlow. As soon
as we sell some of your paintings.

227
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,834
Just a minute, Mr. Marlow.

228
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,720
Let me make my position clear.

229
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,870
What do you think?

230
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,512
I think it'll hold coffee.

231
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,512
Would you try it, Mr. Marlow?

232
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,830
Put your finger through
the handle, please.

233
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,875
How about the size?
What about the handle?

234
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,120
Hmm?

235
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,235
I mean, does it fit?
Is it the right finger size?

236
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,959
It's my finger size.

237
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,036
I'll take it.

238
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,759
Fifteen cents.

239
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,479
- And the saucer?
- Ten.

240
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,392
That seems a fair price.

241
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,631
What's the finger size
got to do with it?

242
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,872
Um... I wanted to be certain
it would fit a man.

243
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,198
- A certain size man.
- A man?

244
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:04,194
A certain somebody is coming over
to my cottage this afternoon.

245
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,475
Not really?

246
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,552
For coffee and blueberry muffins.

247
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,797
Why, you old social butterfly, you.

248
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,595
Old?

249
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,751
That was figuratively
speaking, Miss Gravely.

250
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,479
Think we've got
a nearsighted cider customer.

251
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,911
How old do you think I am, young man?

252
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,430
Mmm...

253
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,918
Fifty. How old do you think you are?

254
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,798
Forty-two.

255
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,837
I can show you my birth certificate.

256
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,216
I'm afraid you're gonna
have to show more

257
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,755
than your birth certificate
to convince a man of that.

258
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,840
What do you mean?

259
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,752
I mean you have to show your character.

260
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,117
The inner self. The hidden qualities.

261
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,318
The true Miss Gravely,
sensitive, young in feeling,

262
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,199
timeless with love and understanding.

263
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,159
I can do it.

264
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,357
At least I think I can do it.

265
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,440
Do what?

266
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,616
Well, I think I'll just go out
and see what that gentleman wants.

267
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,552
At a time like this?
Where are your scissors?

268
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,270
- Outside.
- We're going to cut her hair.

269
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,999
- Hair?
- Cut it short.

270
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,710
Bring it up to date.
Make a nice romantic styling.

271
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,712
Take ten years off
your birth certificate.

272
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,950
How are you fixed for ribbon?

273
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,474
Should be some around somewhere.

274
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,751
- Powder, rouge, lipstick?
- I think so.

275
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,594
Nothing cheap, shoddy or obvious.

276
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,991
Just youth, gentility, character.

277
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,715
I'll go out and get the scissors.
You find the other things.

278
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,673
- Ah! Here they are.
- Excuse me, young man, I...

279
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,910
Oh, well.

280
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,036
All right, Ernest, let's go.

281
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,117
Well, always grow back, I guess.

282
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:13,511
- There's Calvin.
- Is he alone?

283
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,876
Yep. Guess he didn't sell his car.

284
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,280
Hey. Would you mind
getting out of my picture?

285
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,799
Next thing you know,
they'll be televising the whole thing.

286
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,840
Uh...

287
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,275
- This your body, little man?
- Oh, don't turn me in.

288
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,920
It was an accident, an accident,
pure and simple.

289
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,080
I thought he was a rabbit
or a pheasant or something.

290
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,799
It could have happened to you.

291
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,496
Suppose we straighten
this whole thing out?

292
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,751
Well, I guess that's the only way out.

293
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,395
First thing I seen
when I rolled out this morning

294
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,080
was a double-breasted robin,
drunk as a hoot owl

295
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,436
from eating fermented chokecherries.

296
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,671
Right away I knew
somebody was in trouble.

297
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,798
What I didn't know was that it was me.

298
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,115
Well, the larder was empty,

299
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,440
and I got to thinking
about a toothful of fried rabbit...

300
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,791
Stands to reason they
can't touch you for it.

301
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,556
Nothing these days stands to reason.

302
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,711
It was accidental,
an act of God, perhaps.

303
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,880
In a way you should be grateful
that you were able to do your share

304
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,351
in accomplishing
the destiny of a fellow being.

305
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,279
Suppose, for instance,
it was written in the Book of Heaven

306
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:41,398
that this man was to die
at this particular time

307
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,392
at this particular place.

308
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,836
And suppose for a moment the actual

309
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,674
accomplishing of his departure
had been bungled.

310
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,673
Something gone wrong. Uh...

311
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,672
Perhaps it was meant
to be a thunderbolt

312
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,956
and there was no thunder
available, say.

313
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,680
Then you come along, and you shoot him

314
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:03,915
and heaven's will is done
and destiny fulfilled.

315
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,229
Your conscience is quite clear.

316
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,834
You got nothing to worry about.

317
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,754
Sammy, I haven't got a conscience

318
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,672
and it's not heaven that's worrying me

319
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,752
'cause I don't expect
I'll ever have to face it.

320
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,320
And it's none of those noble things
you were talking about, no.

321
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,155
Nothing like that.

322
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,993
Then what is it?

323
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,800
It's me. It's me that's worrying me.

324
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,520
Me and my future life.

325
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,916
I know the police
and their suspicious ways.

326
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,037
You're guilty until
you're proved innocent.

327
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,191
I want nothing more to do with them.

328
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,237
Bury him, I say,
and have done with him.

329
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,551
He's no good to anyone now.

330
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,953
Lay him to rest.
Put him under the sod. Forget him.

331
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,635
I never did it, and you never saw him.

332
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,696
Yes, what about all those
other people who saw him?

333
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,473
How about the woman and the little boy?

334
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,631
Miss Gravely and the tramp

335
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,757
and the man who was reading
the book, Dr. Greenbow.

336
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,157
How about all of them?

337
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,476
Nobody was interested, I tell you.

338
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,711
Nobody ever cared until you came along.

339
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,354
Ah. That's what you think.

340
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,239
Suppose someone starts to care
after you've buried him.

341
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,358
I can't wait for people to start
caring whenever they feel like it.

342
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,000
I don't want a little accident
to turn into a career.

343
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,912
Suppose that woman
who called him Harry.

344
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,231
Suppose she decides
she loves him after all.

345
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,631
She was downright
hysterical with delight.

346
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,836
What was she like?

347
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:21,391
Pretty as a rainbow.
Wish I was two years younger.

348
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,240
- And with a little boy?
- About four or five years of age.

349
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,158
It's got to be Mrs. Rogers and her son.

350
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,720
Sammy,

351
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,077
what do you say we slip him underground now
that you've finished drawing him? Eh?

352
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,675
We could discuss
the smaller details later.

353
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,000
I don't like it.

354
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,356
The authorities like
to know when people die.

355
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:43,391
All right, Sammy. Forget it.

356
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,876
You cut off home.

357
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,350
I killed him, and I'll
look after his remains.

358
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:52,036
What will you do, drag him around
the countryside the rest of the day?

359
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,278
I'll do my best.
That's all a man can do.

360
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,398
If you're not careful, you will get
a murder charge lined up.

361
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,790
Matter of fact, I'm beginning
to suspect something myself.

362
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,519
There you are then. See?

363
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,398
If you, an artist, suspect the worst,

364
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,120
what are they, the police,
going to think?

365
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,550
What about that envelope
with his name and address on it?

366
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,155
By rights you should
mail him back home.

367
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,880
Sammy, have you forgotten

368
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,038
who carries the mail
down to the station every night?

369
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:21,039
Calvin Wiggs, deputy sheriff.

370
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,237
Yes, you're right.

371
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,471
Tell you what we'll do.

372
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,153
Tell you what.

373
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,755
We'll find out how well
Mrs. Rogers knows this man

374
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,480
and whether she intends to notify
the police of his death.

375
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,512
What good will that do?

376
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,000
A lot of good.

377
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,833
If she's just a distant friend of his

378
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,389
who doesn't intend
to notify the authorities,

379
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,039
then I personally
will help you bury Harry.

380
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,912
Oh, Sammy, you've signed on
for the cruise.

381
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,314
What time is it?

382
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,672
- About noon.
- Good heavens!

383
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,056
I've got to go home and spruce up.

384
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,400
I've got a date with Miss Gravely.

385
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,031
Not you?

386
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,315
You're not the one.

387
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,352
Oh, Sam, she could do
a lot worse, you know.

388
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,238
Couldn't do any better.

389
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,358
Just think, you'll be
establishing a precedent.

390
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,432
I'm not establishing nothing.

391
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,752
I'm going over for some
blueberry muffins and coffee

392
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,832
by her own invitation.

393
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,554
And, possibly, some elderberry wine.

394
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:27,190
Do you realize that
you'll be the first man to

395
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,879
cross her threshold?

396
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,320
Hmm.

397
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:34,630
It's not too late, you know.

398
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,951
She's a well-preserved woman.

399
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:40,391
- I envy you.
- Yes. Very well-preserved.

400
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,996
And preserves have
to be opened someday.

401
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,510
Yes. You just trot down
and see what Mrs. Rogers has to say.

402
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,678
- How about hiding Harry first.
- Holy smoke!

403
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,912
Forgetting a little detail
like that could hang a man.

404
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,712
Oh, I beg your pardon.

405
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:51,477
I hope I never have to be
operated on by Dr. Greenbow.

406
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,392
- Come on. Let's get going.
- Yeah.

407
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,480
Good afternoon.

408
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,195
You're beautiful, wonderful.

409
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,636
You're the most wonderful,
beautiful thing I've ever seen.

410
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,677
I'd like to paint you.

411
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:09,516
Is there something else you wanted,
Mr. Marlow, isn't it?

412
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:14,433
You certainly are a lovely woman.
I'd like to paint you nude.

413
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:18,150
Some other time, Mr. Marlow.
I was about to make Arnie some lemonade.

414
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,038
Oh, yes, yes, of course.

415
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,117
Perhaps I've come at an awkward moment.

416
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,034
If you want to undress me, you have.

417
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:28,238
It wasn't exactly that. I came here
to talk to you about something

418
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,119
but after I saw you,
it slipped my mind.

419
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,835
- Couldn't have been very important, then.
- Yes, you're right.

420
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,152
Why don't you sit down on the porch?

421
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,550
I'll get you a lemonade,
and maybe you'll think of it.

422
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,195
You're not only beautiful,
you're considerate, too.

423
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,510
- Arnie!
- Hello, Mr. Marlow.

424
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,637
Hi. What have you got? A rabbit?

425
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,672
Dead. What have you got?

426
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,760
Oh!

427
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,640
I got me a little frog.

428
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,640
There he is.

429
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,717
It's hungry. It needs a mother.

430
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,040
- I'll trade ya.
- Your mother for mine?

431
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,680
- The rabbit for the frog.
- It's yours, Arnie.

432
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,517
I think you got the best deal.

433
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,512
Dead rabbits don't eat.

434
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,638
I'll just take it in the kitchen
and give him some lemonade.

435
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,555
Four rabbits' feet, and he got killed.

436
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,280
He should have carried
a four-leaf clover, too.

437
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,238
And a horseshoe.

438
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,880
Say, how do rabbits get to be born?

439
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,680
- Same way elephants do.
- Oh, sure.

440
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,639
How come you never came over
to visit me before?

441
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,632
Didn't know you had
such a pretty mother, Arnie.

442
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,000
If you think she's pretty,
you should see my slingshot.

443
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,837
- Hmm. Perhaps I'll come back tomorrow.
- When's that?

444
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,320
Day after today.

445
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,750
That's yesterday. Today's tomorrow.

446
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,920
It was?

447
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,795
When was tomorrow yesterday,
Mr. Marlow?

448
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,798
- Today.
- Oh, sure. Yesterday.

449
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,839
You'll never make sense out of Arnie.
He's got his own timing.

450
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,154
- Lemonade, Arnie?
- I already swiped two glasses.

451
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:28,551
- I would have given you two glasses.
- It's more fun swiped.

452
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,319
- Can I borrow your rabbit, Mr. Marlow?
- Sure, Arnie.

453
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,720
What are you gonna do with it?

454
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,395
You never know when
a dead rabbit might come in handy.

455
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,110
It already got me one frog.

456
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,760
Arnie, where you going now?

457
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,116
To make some more trades.

458
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,115
- Arnie, come home in time for supper.
- I'll try.

459
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,159
What's your given name? If you don't want
to tell me, just make one up.

460
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,758
Jennifer. Jennifer Rogers.

461
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,115
Nice.

462
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,240
Um...

463
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,551
Who's the man up on the path?

464
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,878
- What man?
- You know, Harry, the dead man.

465
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:16,873
Oh, him. That's my husband.

466
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,992
Your husband's dead, then?

467
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,799
Is your lemonade sweet enough?

468
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,951
- Seems to be.
- I like it tart.

469
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,392
Harry is Arnie's father then?

470
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,676
- No, Arnie's father's dead.
- So is Harry.

471
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,479
Thank goodness.
He was too good to live.

472
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,359
From his looks, he didn't appear
to be the kind that was "too good."

473
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,955
Well, he was. Horribly good.

474
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,032
I like your mouth, too.

475
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,555
Especially when you say "good."

476
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,351
- Will you have some more lemonade?
- Maybe later. Thanks.

477
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,432
Where'd Arnie get the rabbit?

478
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:01,511
He found it. I think
Captain Wiles shot it.

479
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,638
I'd like to hear more of your life story,
if you don't mind.

480
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,760
You see, we don't know
quite what to do with Harry.

481
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,150
Thought you might
have some suggestions.

482
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,391
You can stuff him, for all I care.

483
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,476
Stuff him and put him in a glass case.

484
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,394
Only I'd suggest frosted glass.

485
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,954
What did he do to you,
besides marry you?

486
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:30,913
Look. I've wanted to explain
about Harry a lot of times.

487
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,755
Nobody would understand,
least of all Harry.

488
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,711
But you, you've got an artistic mind.

489
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,598
You can see the finer things.

490
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,479
When I'm lucky. Go on.
Tell me everything.

491
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,153
Let it all out.

492
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,917
It was a long time ago,
and I was in love.

493
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,469
- I was too much in love.
- What was his name?

494
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,273
Robert.

495
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:59,637
We'd agreed to overlook each other's families
and everything and get married.

496
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,120
Did you?

497
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,554
Oh, yes.

498
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,718
And then Robert got killed.

499
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,800
Oh?

500
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,638
I was heartbroken

501
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:14,749
for six weeks, and then I discovered
little Arnie was on the way.

502
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:18,470
- Must have been a shock.
- That's where Harry came in.

503
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,230
Harry the handsome hero.

504
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,358
Harry the saint. Harry the good.

505
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,154
- I didn't catch his last name.
- Harry Worp.

506
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,038
Robert's brother. His older brother.

507
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,157
And he fell in love with you?

508
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:34,358
If he'd fallen in love with me,
I wouldn't have minded.

509
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,717
He wanted to marry me because
he was Robert's brother and felt noble.

510
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,360
But you thought he was
in love with you.

511
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,394
And I decided to let him
love me because of Arnie.

512
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,200
It was on my second wedding night
that I learned the truth.

513
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,794
You didn't learn on your first?

514
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:57,078
This was a terrible truth.

515
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,231
The truth about Harry.

516
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,800
Just what happened?

517
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,312
How old are you, Mr. Marlow?

518
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,070
About thirty.

519
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,237
This is what happened.

520
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,915
I was in the hotel room alone.

521
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,834
I put on my best nightie.
You understand?

522
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,760
Perfectly.

523
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,231
Although I had
no true feeling for Harry,

524
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,437
I had worked myself
into a certain enthusiasm

525
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,591
because I thought he loved me.

526
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,878
Must have been hard work.

527
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,759
There was a full moon,
and I sat by the window

528
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,912
because I thought it would show off
my new nightie to advantage.

529
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,073
Naturally.

530
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,631
I don't know why
I'm telling you all this.

531
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:47,839
You, a perfect stranger, too.
I'm not boring you, am I?

532
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,280
No, no, not at all.

533
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,111
- How about some more lemonade?
- Soon.

534
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,153
Where was I?

535
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,110
You were sitting by the window
because it was a full moon

536
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,920
and you'd worked yourself up
to a certain enthusiasm?

537
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,677
I said all that?

538
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,797
When does Harry come in?

539
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,955
He doesn't. He never came in.

540
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,191
He called the following morning.

541
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,511
The following morning?

542
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,638
In the hotel lobby the night before,
he had bought a magazine.

543
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,076
- His horoscope was in it.
- Bad?

544
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,036
It said... He was a Taurus.

545
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:28,079
It said, "Don't start
any new project that day.

546
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,630
"It could never be finished."

547
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,915
And what did you do?

548
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,913
I left him on the spot
and went home to Mother's.

549
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,195
The end.

550
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,352
What a poignant story.

551
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,592
I knew you'd understand.
Nobody else does.

552
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,796
Not even Mother?

553
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,759
Well, she thought I should live
with him, but I wouldn't.

554
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:50,516
He pestered me to go back,
but I always refused.

555
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,991
Suppose some night
I wanted him to do something.

556
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,549
Like the dishes, for example.

557
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,597
His horoscope just wouldn't let him.

558
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,194
You're absolutely right.

559
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:03,717
There are some things I just
don't like to do by myself.

560
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,793
And no one with any true understanding
would blame you for it.

561
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,919
Soon as Arnie was born

562
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,281
I moved away to where I thought
Harry could never find me.

563
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,955
I changed my name and...

564
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:19,192
But he was persistent?

565
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,357
This morning there was a knock
on the door.

566
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,353
Before I opened it, I knew
he was standing on the other side.

567
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:27,035
- What did he want?
- Me.

568
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,840
He wanted me because I was his wife.

569
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,310
He wanted me because,
as he put it, he suddenly felt

570
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,120
some basic urge. Loneliness.

571
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,555
What did you feel?

572
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,233
I felt sick.

573
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,437
Did you see his mustache
and his wavy hair?

574
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,193
When I saw him, he was dead.

575
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:46,035
He looked the same when he was alive,
except he was vertical.

576
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,680
So he entered. What did you say?

577
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,798
Nothing. I hit him over the head
with a milk bottle and knocked him silly.

578
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:53,680
Silly?

579
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,637
Bats. Tappy.

580
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,752
He went staggering up towards the woods

581
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:01,833
saying he was gonna find his wife
and drag her home if it killed him.

582
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:03,916
Apparently it did.

583
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,956
Have some more lemonade.

584
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,992
Why, Captain Wiles, what a surprise.

585
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,276
But you invited me, Miss Gravely.

586
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,113
At least, that's how I remember it.

587
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:02,950
Of course I did, Captain,
but somehow it's still a surprise.

588
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,596
Yeah.

589
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,149
You certainly know
how to make a man feel wanted.

590
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,994
Won't you come in, Captain?

591
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:13,915
Thank you. I've looked forward to it.

592
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:32,674
Takes a real cook to make
a good blueberry muffin

593
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,760
to keep the blueberries
from sitting on the bottom.

594
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,560
High-bush blueberries.

595
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,233
That's the secret.

596
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:43,435
I picked them up near where you shot
that unfortunate man.

597
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:51,000
A real, handsome, man's cup.

598
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,715
It's been in the family for years.

599
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,032
My father always used it,
up until he died.

600
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,512
I trust he died peacefully,
slipped away in the night?

601
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,592
He was caught in a threshing machine.

602
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,557
I hope I haven't
distressed you, Captain.

603
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,791
Not at all, Miss Gravely. Not at all.

604
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,873
I'm used to looking
on the rough side of things.

605
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:20,156
I'm a man who's faced death many times.

606
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:22,869
Rather recently, too.

607
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,630
Yes.

608
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,077
Arnie, what are you carrying there?

609
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,276
A rabbit.

610
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,510
A rabbit?

611
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,518
- What do you call it?
- Dead.

612
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,557
- It ain't mine.
- Whose is it?

613
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:44,360
Yours. You shot it with your gun.

614
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:46,477
You must have killed it today.

615
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,656
It should make a nice stew for you.

616
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:50,400
A rabbit! I finally killed a rabbit!

617
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,951
- Where did you find it?
- In the blueberry muffins.

618
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,960
- What?
- Out in the woods.

619
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,759
Here you are. One muffin for one rabbit.
Fair enough?

620
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:05,278
That was a two-muffin rabbit.

621
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,352
- I gotta go now.
- Oh.

622
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,040
Mmm...

623
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:24,637
It's certainly a nice
afternoon, Miss Gravely.

624
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,035
Isn't it.

625
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:31,800
Yes, and you're a nice woman.

626
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:36,352
And I think you're awfully nice,
Captain Wiles.

627
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:40,754
Um... Let's get back
to our little problem. Harry.

628
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,035
What's going to become of him?

629
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,998
Oh, now, now,
don't you worry about Harry.

630
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:46,356
He'll be comfortably
underground before nightfall.

631
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,957
All that digging and work.

632
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:53,159
Couldn't you just let him slide
off the end of your boat pier

633
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,799
into the pond?

634
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:58,032
And have him pop up like a cork?

635
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:01,955
No, sir. Nobody ever popped up
from under four feet of ground.

636
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,837
No. Besides, they'll be cutting ice
there this winter.

637
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,639
Now, wouldn't it be a nice thing

638
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,136
if they were cutting
blocks of ice and...

639
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,914
Never mind, Captain. You're right.

640
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,037
Yes, underground
is the best place for Harry.

641
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:45,791
He seems comfortable, Sam.
Very comfortable and snug.

642
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,634
We'd better find a place and
get it dug, and the sooner the better.

643
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,480
If what you're telling me about Mrs. Rogers
and her husband is right,

644
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:52,880
I agree with you, Sammy.

645
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,680
Let's find a place.

646
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,558
No use making hard work out of it.

647
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,518
We need a place where
the earth is soft.

648
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:05,198
Yeah, and a place where the whole town
won't stumble over us as we work.

649
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,397
A place with a certain character
and attractiveness.

650
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:10,837
Facing west, so that Harry
can watch the setting sun.

651
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,431
- Where it'll be cozy in winter.
- And cool in the summer.

652
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:17,831
You know, I'm half envying Harry.

653
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:20,998
Wouldn't take much longer
to dig it twice as wide.

654
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:24,517
Thanks for your kindness,
but some other time.

655
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,235
- This looks like a good place.
- Ah!

656
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,312
You're a lucky fellow, Harry Worp.

657
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,995
- Come on, Captain, off with your coat.
- Who, me?

658
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,112
Certainly you.
It's your body, isn't it?

659
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,237
I'm not much of a hand
at grave-digging.

660
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:50,080
You should have thought of that
before you went hunting this morning.

661
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,673
Calvin Wiggs. What do we do now?

662
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,276
Think up the best story
he's ever heard.

663
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,475
Lay down your shovel, Sam.

664
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:27,676
What's the trouble?

665
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,080
I'm dead beat.

666
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,990
Good. I was dead beat ten minutes ago.

667
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:35,515
I wanted to keep digging
until you gave up.

668
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,674
Gives me the creeps.

669
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,912
What? Come on.
Let's get Harry and pop him in.

670
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,432
With hasty reverence.

671
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:07,151
Would you like to say
a few words, Captain?

672
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:11,996
That I would. Harry Worp, don't ever
show your face around here again.

673
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:19,440
Let's finish this job
and get out of here.
