Summarize briefly which other texts this text is referencing, directly or indirectly. This may include direct reciting of poetry, including in creative ways (mixing various texts and themes, creatively modifying metaphors and citations on the go).

Make sure to analyze the entire text, to the end. 

Return a BRIEF summary, prioritizing exhaustiveness and precision over explanations. 

Note that the text is imperfect: it is an autotranscription of audio subtitles. There will be mistakes in the transcription, so you should pay more attention to the overall message. It may well be possible that some important, subtle references are causing the errors in the transcription, since they are very original and unexpected. Just do your best. 

Start with a sentence or two describing the overall topic/message of the text, but then focus on briefly but exhaustively listing all references that you can identify.

If there are any direct citations, including of poetry, list those with a special note ("direct citation"; "poetry").
