You are given film subtitles. 

1. Provide a short summary of the film, using external resources (the Internet). Focus on what makes the film special.


2. Provide a detailed description, in the original language of the subtitles, of the film's structure and creative characteristics  such that it later helps with translating the subtitles into other languages. It should be categories with lists of specific items/examples taken verbatim from the subtitles rather than smooth-looking non-specific summary text. 

The categories should include: list of characters and their descriptions; list of jokes and memes; list of intertextual references; list of other passages challenging for translation. Do not stop at just a few examples; go through the whole file, for each category. Pay special attention to subtleties, humor, and tone. 

Prioritize exhaustiveness and precision over lengthy/wordy explanations. Do not make things up. Lit as many characters/examples as possible. Just 4-5 examples in each category is not enough.
