Identify any errors which may be due to auto-transcription. 

1) Ignore issues related to fragmentation and time codes; the text is coherent and we do not want to correct the author; only how the automatic transcription may have misheard the author.

2) The podcase name is "Армен и Федор". The text is split with time codes, so some sentences may be fragmented. Consider things in large context.

3) The errors will often be correct Russian words but used in a wrong case, form, agreement.

4) The errors may be related to the subtlety of referencing OTHER TEXTS. They may be due to the original audio containing some FOREIGN (non-Russian) words, especially those ASSOCIATED with the REFERENCES. Therefore, it is useful to use the knowledge of literary, historical plots, and so on, to better correct the text. For example, if the text is referencing a Spanish text, there are likely to be words of Spanish origin there. Etc. 

5) If the entire subtitle segment (or several) look like complete nonsense not having anything to do with the overall topic, this is probably because the author was talking in a foreign language all this time, or was broadcasting some external video. In such cases, please replace the transcription with "НЕРАЗБОРЧИВО".


The goal is to have a coherent Russian text (albeit fragmented by subtitle time codes) that is faithful with respect to referenced text and the author's subtle intentions.
