HINTS: (Do NOT icnlude any of this in your output!!!)

The text is from a podcast dedicated to world literature. The content creator uses many references to various texts. He often uses words from other languages, especially from Spanish, also English. A precise translation will reflect that. Some of the texts the content creator tends to reference include (but are not limited to) Don Quixote and Ulysses. 

The content creator of the Russian original uses a wealth of references and metaphors. He may be referring to various world literature characters not only by their names but by the various epithets which are established in the discourse. 

All of this needs to be taken into account, especially because the original Russian subs may contain auto-transcription errors. In such cases, it is probable that a foreign word was used to refer to some text. 

In this episode, there is a comparison of Dostoyevsky's "Demons" to Don Quixote. Specifically, a dialog between Sancho Panza and Don Quixote is referenced. Don Quixote is called хитроумный идальго in lines 84-85 of the original; note that the Spanish word идальго is likely to be misparsed in the original subtitles.

Are there any possible errors in the original Russian subs that could be due to auto-transcription of foreign words or words that are highly unusual for the context because they are referencing other texts? NOTE: Do NOT include your reasoning or answer into the output; only output the final version of the text.
