HINTS: (Do NOT icnlude any of this in your output!!!)

The text is from a podcast dedicated to world literature. The content creator uses many references to various texts. He often uses words from other languages, especially from Spanish, also English. A precise translation will reflect that. Some of the texts the content creator tends to reference include (but are not limited to) Don Quixote and Ulysses. 

The content creator of the Russian original uses a wealth of references and metaphors. He may be referring to various world literature characters not only by their names but by the various epithets which are established in the discourse. 

All of this needs to be taken into account, especially because the original Russian subs may contain auto-transcription errors. In such cases, it is probable that a foreign word was used to refer to some text. 

In this episode, there is a comparison of Dostoyevsky's "Demons" to Don Quixote.
