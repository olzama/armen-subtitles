The original text is a podcast about the world's literature. The language is highly creative and original, with many references to other texts.

It is of utmost importance that the subtitles stay on track with respect to the time codes.

IMPORTANT: if the translation contains material from more than one original segment but is put in one segment for coherence, ADJUST the time codes slightly. For example, if one translated segment contains material from the two original segments, such a translated segment should end a few seconds later than the original while the next one should start a few seconds later.


Finally, translate poetry as poetry, and pay attention to unusual metaphors:

Metaphor: косточка на торте этой сцены (neologistic metaphor, mixes cherry on top with a chilling effect of referencing death)

Poetry: Children's poem about Barabek.
