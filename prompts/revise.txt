Revise the following text given the summary. The text was originally an automatic transcription, and some subtle transcription errors persist.

Go over the text line by line, and, given the summary, look for possible errors in the transcription (due to e.g. use of foreign (non-Russian) or unexpected words which were misinterpreted as more common words).

Are there any portions which seem odd, like they don't really make sense? Anything that does not correspond to what actually happened in the referenced texts?
