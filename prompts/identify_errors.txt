Identify any errors which may be due to wrong auto-transcription in the original Russian subtitle text. 

1) Ignore issues related to fragmentation and time codes! The text is split with time codes, so some sentences may be fragmented, that is expected. Consider things in large context. However, you may remove any obvious duplication (only within one subtitle line; do not remove any subtitle items).

2) Do not try to improve the author's intentions! The goal is to catch where the automatic transcription got the author wrong because it misheard him, not because the original could be better!

3) The podcase name is "Армен и Федор". 

4) As you analyze the text, ask yourself: Are there portions (within or ACROSS the lines) that don't make sense? Odd syntax, agreement, case errors, other oddities? Other situations which may be due to preferring a common word over something unexpected or metaphoric or foreign that simply SOUNDS like the common Russian word? Anything that leads to wrong interpretations of the referenced texts? If the text is retelling another text, are the facts correct regarding who did/said what to whom? If not, this may be because of a subtle transcription error! 

5) Many errors will be due to the original audio containing some FOREIGN (non-Russian) words, especially those ASSOCIATED with the REFERENCES. Therefore, it is useful to use the knowledge of literary, historical plots, and so on, to better correct the text. For example, if the text is referencing a Spanish text, there are likely to be words of Spanish origin there. Etc. Ask yourself: Which episodes from other texts are described? Are the facts given correctly? Could a subtle transcription error due to a foreign or unusual word cause the wrong narrative which the author did not originally have in the audio? You must actually consider the referenced texts carefully to catch as many such issues as possible. Your hints are oddities in syntax and factual mistakes, NOT the overall creativity and richness of the text.

Identify such errors (they may span more than one subtitle line).
