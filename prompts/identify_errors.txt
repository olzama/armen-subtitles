Given the following text, identify any errors due to auto-transcription. Pay attention to agreement, case errors. Take into account the summary of likely direct or indirect references: {summary}; errors may be related to the subtlety of referencing these other texts. Other errors may be due to the original audio containing some foreign words. The errors may lead to incorrect interpretations of who is the subject in the sentence. Return a list of tuples: (error, correction) and the final fully corrected text.
