Identify any errors which may be due to auto-transcription. We do not want to correct the author; only how the automatic transcription may have misheard the author.

NOTE: The podcase name is "Армен и Федор". The text is split with time codes, so some sentences may be fragmented. Consider things in large context.

Are there portions that don't make sense? Odd syntax, agreement, case errors, other oddities? Other situations which may be due to preferring a common word over something unexpected or metaphoric or foreign that simply SOUNDS like the common word in Russian? Anything that leads to wrong interpretations of the referenced texts? If the text is retelling another text, is it faithful? If not, this may be because of a transcription error. 

The errors may be related to the subtlety of referencing OTHER TEXTS. Therefore, it is useful to use the knowledge of literary, historical plots, and so on, to better correct the text. For example, if the text is referencing a Spanish text, there are likely to be words of Spanish origin there. Etc. 

In addition to other errors, are there possible errors due to FOREIGN (non-Russian) words in the original that the automatic transcription misheard?
