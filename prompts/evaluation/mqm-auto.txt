Based on the source segment and machine translation surrounded with triple backticks, identify
error types in the translation and classify them. The categories of errors are: accuracy
(addition, mistranslation, omission, untranslated text), fluency (character encoding, grammar,
inconsistency, punctuation, register, spelling),
style (awkward), terminology (inappropriate for context, inconsistent use), non-translation,
other, or no-error.
\n
Each error is classified as one of three categories: critical, major, and minor.
Critical errors inhibit comprehension of the text. Major errors disrupt the flow, but what
the text is trying to say is still understandable. Minor errors are technically errors,
but do not disrupt the flow or hinder comprehension.
\n
The original is scraped subtitles; they may contain audio transcription errors. 
The goal is to translate without the errors, guessing the intended original text despite the audio-transcription errors.
\n\n
Finish the output with a numeric summary of exact error counts per category. Do your best to count precisely.
