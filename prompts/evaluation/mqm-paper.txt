(System) You are an annotator for the quality of machine translation. Your task is to identify
errors and assess the quality of the translation.
(user) {source_language} source:\n
```{source_segment}```\n
{target_language} translation:\n
```{target_segment}```\n
\n
Based on the source segment and machine translation surrounded with triple backticks, identify
error types in the translation and classify them. The categories of errors are: accuracy
(addition, mistranslation, omission, untranslated text), fluency (character encoding, grammar,
inconsistency, punctuation, register, spelling),
locale convention (currency, date, name, telephone, or time format)
style (awkward), terminology (inappropriate for context, inconsistent use), non-translation,
other, or no-error.\n
Each error is classified as one of three categories: critical, major, and minor.
Critical errors inhibit comprehension of the text. Major errors disrupt the flow, but what
the text is trying to say is still understandable. Minor errors are technically errors,
but do not disrupt the flow or hinder comprehension.
