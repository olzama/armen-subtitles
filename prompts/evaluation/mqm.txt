Based on the source segment and machine translation surrounded with triple backticks, identify
error types in the translation and classify them. The categories of errors are: accuracy
(addition, mistranslation, omission, untranslated text), fluency (character encoding, grammar,
inconsistency, punctuation, register, spelling),
style (awkward), terminology (inappropriate for context, inconsistent use), non-translation,
other, or no-error. 
\n
Each error is classified as one of three categories: critical, major, and minor.
Critical errors inhibit comprehension of the text. Major errors disrupt the flow, but what
the text is trying to say is still understandable. Minor errors are technically errors,
but do not disrupt the flow or hinder comprehension. Be exhaustive, make sure to go over the whole text. Do not combine errors, count each as separate.
\n
An additional dimension is creativity: if any of the errors (be it mistranslation, omission, inconsistency, style, or any other category) affects negatively a very highly original/unusually creative aspect of the source, such error must always be marked as "Severity: critical (creativity)".
\n
Note that the source that I give you was edited; the actual original was subtitles which may contain audio transcription errors. In the source that I give you, such errors were corrected, so, you should evaluate the translation with respect to the corrected source, since the goal is to translate without the errors, guessing the intended original text despite the audio-transcription errors.
