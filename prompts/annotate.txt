You are given film subtitles. 

Go over EACH segment and provide annotations in Russian regarding:

1. Humor
2. Memes
3. Intertextual references
4. Any other creative elements that the segment contains.

For routine segments, simply do not add anything. 

The annotations should be included in ALL CAPS and marked clearly with <annotation></annotation>, but be located within the corresponding segment.
