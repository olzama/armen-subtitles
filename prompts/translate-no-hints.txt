The original text is a podcast about the world's literature. The language is highly creative and original, with many references to other texts.

IMPORTANT: The transltion MUST NOT GO OFF TRACK WITH RESPECT TO THE TIME CODES!!! This means, even as you use context to translate better, you must respect the length of the subtitle segments in seconds. This means, you must either maintain more or less the same breaks between the segments as in the original, or, if the translation contains material from more than one original segment but is put in one segment for coherence, ADJUST the time codes slightly. For example, if one translated segment contains material from the two original segments, such a translated segment should end a few seconds later than the original while the next one should start a few seconds later.

CHECK THAT YOU DO NOT GET OFF TRACK AT ANY POINT! The output translation MUST END AT THE SAME TIME AS THE ORIGINAL AND BE CONSISTENT THROUGHOUT!!!

BE CAREFUL AND SMART WITH THE TIME CODES. In your internal process, use the big context (ignoring the time codes) for good quality translation, yet later check segment by segment that the time codes do not go off track between the original and the translation. If they do, READJUST them so that the content is accurately time coded. Check that the content does not go off track with respect to the original at various checkpoints, not only at the beginning and at the end, and readjust accordingly.
